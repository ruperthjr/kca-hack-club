##  Study Strategies

### For Success

1. **Don't Just Read - Do Problems**
   - Read theory: 30% of time
   - Solve problems: 70% of time
   - You learn by doing, not reading

2. **Master Proofs Early**
   - First 2 weeks are critical
   - Write proofs by hand
   - Check with peers/tutors

3. **Use Multiple Resources**
   - If Rosen confuses you, try Levin
   - If reading doesn't work, watch videos
   - Everyone learns differently

4. **Form a Study Group**
   - Meet 2x per week
   - Work through problems together
   - Teach each other

5. **Practice, Practice, Practice**
   - Aim for 100+ problems over the semester
   - Focus on problem types that appear in exams
   - Time yourself on practice exams

---

### Study Group Activities

**Weekly Meetup Structure** (2 hours):
- 15 min: Review concepts from this week
- 45 min: Work through problem set together
- 30 min: Practice proofs on whiteboard
- 30 min: Quiz each other, discuss difficult problems

**Discord Channel**: #discrete-mathematics

**Best Practices**:
- Rotate who explains concepts each week
- Share notes and solutions
- Help each other get unstuck
- Accountability partners for assignments

---

##  Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

###  Pitfall 1: Not Practicing Proofs
**Result**: Struggle on 50% of exam  
**Solution**: Write 3 proofs per week minimum

###  Pitfall 2: Memorizing Without Understanding
**Result**: Can't apply to new problems  
**Solution**: Focus on "why" not just "what"

###  Pitfall 3: Falling Behind
**Result**: Everything builds on previous topics  
**Solution**: Stay current, ask for help immediately

###  Pitfall 4: Not Doing Enough Problems
**Result**: Theory knowledge but can't execute  
**Solution**: 10+ problems per topic minimum

###  Pitfall 5: Ignoring Logic & Set Theory
**Result**: Foundation is weak, later topics harder  
**Solution**: Master Weeks 1-3 completely

##  Tips from Past Students

> **Maryphin**: "Graph theory seemed scary but once I coded BFS/DFS it clicked. Highly recommend implementing algorithms as you learn them!"

> **Ruperth**: "Practice exams are gold. I did 8 of them before finals and saw similar problems on the actual exam."

> **Pauline**: "Study group saved me. Explaining proofs to others helped me understand them deeply."

> **Daniel**: "Don't skip the basics. I struggled mid-semester because I didn't fully understand logic. Go back if needed!"

##  Essential Formulas & Theorems

### Must Memorize

**Counting**:
- Permutations: P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!
- Combinations: C(n,r) = n!/[r!(n-r)!]

**Graph Theory**:
- Handshaking Lemma: Σdeg(v) = 2|E|
- Euler path exists iff ≤2 odd-degree vertices
- Tree has |V|-1 edges

**Logic**:
- De Morgan's Laws
- Contrapositive equivalence
- Common logical equivalences

**Download**: Formula sheet in Drive (see links above)
