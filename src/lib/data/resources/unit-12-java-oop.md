## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Everything Public
**Problem**: Making all fields and methods public  
**Result**: No encapsulation, impossible to change implementation  
**Solution**: Default to private, only expose what's necessary through public methods. Use getters/setters for controlled access.

### Mistake 2: God Objects
**Problem**: One massive class doing everything  
**Result**: Unmaintainable, hard to test, violates SRP  
**Solution**: Follow Single Responsibility Principle. One class should have one reason to change. Break large classes into smaller, focused ones.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Exceptions
**Problem**: Empty catch blocks or catching Exception  
**Result**: Silent failures, impossible debugging  
**Solution**: Handle specific exceptions, log errors, don't hide problems. Use specific exception types.

### Mistake 4: String Concatenation in Loops
**Problem**: Using `+` to build strings in loops  
**Result**: Very slow due to String immutability  
**Solution**: Use StringBuilder for string building in loops. Much more efficient.

### Mistake 5: Not Overriding equals() and hashCode()
**Problem**: Using objects in collections without proper equals/hashCode  
**Result**: Collections don't work correctly (duplicates in Sets, can't find in Maps)  
**Solution**: Always override both together. Use IDE to generate them correctly.

### Mistake 6: Inheritance for Code Reuse Only
**Problem**: Using inheritance when composition is better  
**Result**: Tight coupling, fragile base class problem  
**Solution**: Use composition unless true IS-A relationship exists. Favor composition over inheritance.

### Mistake 7: Not Closing Resources
**Problem**: Forgetting to close files, database connections  
**Result**: Resource leaks, file locks, connection pool exhaustion  
**Solution**: Always use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable resources. No excuses.

### Mistake 8: Shared Mutable State in Threads
**Problem**: Multiple threads modifying same data without synchronization  
**Result**: Race conditions, corrupted data, hard-to-reproduce bugs  
**Solution**: Synchronize access to shared mutable state or use immutable objects. Prefer thread-safe collections.

**Remember**: Learning Java and OOP is like learning to think differently about problems. Instead of thinking about steps (procedural), you think about objects and their interactions. This shift takes time, so be patient with yourself. The "aha!" moment will come, and when it does, programming will never be the same.

**Pro tip**: Build something you care about. Don't just do assignments - create a program that solves a problem you have or implements something you're interested in. Passion project beats homework every time for learning.

Good luck, and welcome to the world of professional programming!
