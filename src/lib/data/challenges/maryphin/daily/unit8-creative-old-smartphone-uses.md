# Creative Problem Solving: Repurposing an Old Smartphone

## Overview

This challenge develops your creative problem-solving skills by encouraging you to find new, practical uses for an old smartphone. You'll practice generating diverse ideas, evaluating their feasibility, and clearly communicating your solutions—skills valuable in both technology and everyday life.

## Objective

Invent three distinct, creative, and feasible ways to repurpose a smartphone that can no longer make calls or run modern apps efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- An old smartphone (Android or iOS)
- Basic familiarity with smartphone features and settings
- Access to Wi-Fi
- Ability to install and configure simple apps

## Instructions

### Part 1: Brainstorm Without Limits

- Spend 5 minutes listing every possible use for the old smartphone, regardless of practicality.
- Aim for at least 10 raw ideas. Consider features like the camera, sensors, and connectivity.

### Part 2: Refine and Select

- Review your brainstormed list and remove ideas that are unsafe or impossible.
- Group similar ideas and select the three most promising, creative, and feasible options.

### Part 3: Write Descriptions

- For each selected idea, write 2–3 sentences explaining:
    - The intended use of the smartphone
    - Any modifications, apps, or accessories required
    - Why this is a valuable or innovative reuse

## Deliverables

1. A document listing three creative ideas, each with a title and description
2. Brief explanation of any modifications or apps needed
3. (Optional) One sentence on which idea you would actually try and why

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria    | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Creativity  | 40%    | Solutions go beyond obvious uses and show originality |
| Feasibility | 30%    | Each idea is realistic and achievable with minimal cost/effort |
| Clarity     | 30%    | Descriptions are specific, concise, and easy to understand |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Avoid generic ideas like “sell it” or “recycle it”—focus on creative repurposing.
- Don’t dismiss “silly” ideas too quickly; they can lead to breakthroughs.
- Leverage the phone’s sensors and connectivity for inspiration.
- Ensure safety and privacy when repurposing devices.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Create a simple storyboard or sketch illustrating one of your ideas.
2. Research and summarize a real-world project that repurposes old electronics.

## Submission

Submit your document with your three ideas and descriptions as instructed.
