# Crafting a Standout LinkedIn Summary

## Overview

A compelling LinkedIn summary is your digital elevator pitch, helping recruiters and peers quickly understand your skills, goals, and personality. This challenge guides you in writing a professional summary that sets you apart in the job market.

## Objective

Write a 3–4 sentence LinkedIn “About” section that introduces yourself, highlights your core skills, and outlines your aspirations or the opportunities you seek.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with LinkedIn profiles
- Ability to write in English
- Willingness to reflect on your experience and goals

## Instructions

### Part 1: Brainstorm Your Key Points

- List your current role or education, two core skills, your passions, and the type of opportunity you are seeking.

### Part 2: Draft Your Summary

- Start with a hook (e.g., “I’m a computer science student passionate about data-driven solutions.”)
- Mention your skills or tools (e.g., Python, web development, communication)
- End with a forward-looking statement or call to action.

### Part 3: Revise and Polish

- Remove filler words and clichés.
- Read your summary aloud to check flow and clarity.
- Proofread for spelling and grammar errors.

## Deliverables

1. A 3–4 sentence LinkedIn summary paragraph (plain text)
2. Optional: Screenshot of your summary on your LinkedIn profile
3. Any notes or feedback received from a peer review

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria         | Weight | Description                                         |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Conciseness      | 30%    | 3–4 sentences, focused and to the point             |
| Content          | 40%    | Includes identity, skills, and a goal or interest   |
| Professional Tone| 30%    | Positive, clear, and free of slang or errors        |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Avoid generic phrases like “hardworking”; show your strengths through examples.
- Keep it focused—don’t include your entire life story.
- Use first person (“I”) for a personal touch.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Write a second version tailored for a specific job title or industry.
2. Request feedback from a peer and revise your summary accordingly.

## Submission

Paste your summary into the LMS text box or share a public link to your LinkedIn profile.
