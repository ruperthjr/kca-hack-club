# Weekly Study Hours Excel Tracker

## Overview

This challenge guides you through building an Excel spreadsheet to track your weekly study hours across multiple subjects. You'll practice organizing data, applying formulas, and visualizing your progress—skills valuable for academic and professional data management.

## Objective

Create an Excel workbook that records study hours for a week, calculates totals and averages, and visualizes your study patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet software
- Access to Excel or compatible software
- Sample weekly study schedule

## Instructions

### Part 1: Set Up the Data Table

- Create a worksheet with these column headers:
        - Day of Week, Date, Subject 1, Subject 2, Subject 3, Subject 4, Daily Total, Notes/Observations
- Add rows for each day (Monday–Sunday).
- Reserve rows for Weekly Totals, Daily Averages, and Subject Averages.

### Part 2: Enter Sample Data & Formulas

- Fill in realistic study hours (use decimals and at least one zero).
- Add brief notes for notable days.
- Use formulas:
        - Daily Totals: SUM of subjects per day
        - Weekly Totals: SUM for each subject and daily totals
        - Daily/Subject Averages: AVERAGE functions as appropriate

### Part 3: Format & Visualize

- Bold headers and totals, apply number formatting, and add cell borders.
- Use conditional formatting to highlight high study hours (>3).
- Insert at least one chart (column, line, or pie) to visualize your data with titles and labels.

## Deliverables

1. Excel file named `StudyTracker_YourName.xlsx`
2. Complete data table with formulas and sample data
3. At least one formatted chart
4. Professional formatting and conditional formatting
