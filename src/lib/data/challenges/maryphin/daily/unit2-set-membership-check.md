# Set Membership: Is 7 an Element of `{DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, 8}`?

## Overview

This challenge introduces the concept of set membership, a foundational idea in discrete mathematics. You’ll determine whether a specific element belongs to a set, use proper mathematical notation, and justify your answer clearly.

## Objective

Decide if the number 7 is an element of the set A = `{DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, 8}`, and express your conclusion using correct set membership notation and a brief explanation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of sets and elements
- Familiarity with set notation (∈, ∉)
- Ability to compare numbers and symbols

## Instructions

### Part 1: Review Set Membership

- An element `x` is a member of set `S` if `x` appears in the set's roster.
- Use `x ∈ S` if true, `x ∉ S` if false.

### Part 2: Analyze the Set

- Set A = `{DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, 8}`
- Compare 7 to each element in A.

### Part 3: State and Justify Your Conclusion

- If 7 is not found in the set, write: `7 ∉ {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, 8}`
- Provide a one-sentence justification.

## Deliverables

1. A statement using set membership notation (e.g., `7 ∉ {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, 8}`)
2. A one-sentence explanation justifying your answer
3. (Optional) A written statement in words

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria         | Weight | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Correct answer   | 50%    | States whether 7 is an element of the set        |
| Proper notation  | 30%    | Uses ∈ or ∉ accurately                           |
| Explanation      | 20%    | Justifies the answer with reference to the set   |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Do not confuse “element” with “subset”
- The set contains only even numbers and a string; 7 is odd and not listed
- Use the correct notation for membership (`∈`, `∉`)
- Focus only on the given set

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Write the answer in words: “7 is not an element of the set containing DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, and 8.”
2. Determine if DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ∈ `{DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 4, 6, 8}` and express this using notation.
