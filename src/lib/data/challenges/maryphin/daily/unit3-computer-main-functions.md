# The Four Main Functions of a Computer

## Overview

Every computer system, from mobile devices to servers, relies on four fundamental functions: input, processing, output, and storage. Mastering these concepts is crucial for understanding how computers operate and interact with the world.

## Objective

Identify, define, and provide examples for the four main functions of a computer, and explain how they work together in a typical computing scenario.

## Prerequisites

- No prior knowledge required.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Define Each Function

- Clearly define input, processing, output, and storage.
- Include at least one hardware device example for each function.

### Part 2: Explain Interdependence

- Describe how the four functions interact to complete a computing task.
- Use a real-world example to illustrate the data flow.

### Part 3: Create a Summary

- Write a concise paragraph or draw a simple flow diagram showing how data moves through the four functions.

## Deliverables

1. A document (text, PDF, or image) listing and defining the four functions.
2. At least one hardware example per function.
3. A summary paragraph or flow diagram illustrating the data flow.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                   |
|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Correct identification  | 40%    | All four functions are correctly named.       |
| Accurate definitions    | 30%    | Definitions are clear and technically correct.|
| Examples                | 30%    | Relevant hardware examples are provided.      |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Don’t confuse RAM (volatile memory) with permanent storage (hard drive, SSD).
- Some devices, like touchscreens, can serve as both input and output.
- Processing includes both arithmetic and logical operations.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Research and describe the roles of the control unit and ALU within the processor.
2. Apply the four functions to a specific device, such as a smart thermostat.

## Submission

Submit your completed document or diagram as instructed by your facilitator.
