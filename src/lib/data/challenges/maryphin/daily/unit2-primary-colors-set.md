# Set Notation and Elements: Primary Colors

## Overview

Understanding how to represent collections of objects using set notation is a foundational skill in discrete mathematics and computer science. This challenge uses the concept of primary colors to practice writing and interpreting sets.

## Objective

Correctly list the elements of the set of primary colors using standard mathematical set notation.

## Prerequisites

- No prior knowledge of discrete mathematics required.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Understand Set Notation

- Sets are written with curly braces `{ }`.
- Elements are separated by commas.
- The order of elements does not matter, and each element appears only once.

### Part 2: Identify the Primary Colors

- In traditional color theory (pigments), the primary colors are **red, blue, and yellow**.
- If you prefer the RGB model (light), use **red, green, and blue**. State your assumption.

### Part 3: Write the Set

- Express the set using correct notation, for example: `{red, blue, yellow}`.

## Deliverables

1. A written statement listing the set of primary colors in proper set notation.
2. A brief sentence confirming that order is irrelevant and duplicates are not allowed.
3. Any supporting explanation if you use a different color model.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria           | Weight | Description                                         |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Correct elements   | 40%    | The three correct primary colors are listed.        |
| Proper notation    | 40%    | Curly braces, commas, no duplicates, no extra symbols. |
| Clarity            | 20%    | Explanation is clear and demonstrates understanding.|

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Only include primary colors, not secondary ones.
- Do not use quotation marks unless defining a set of strings.
- Sets are unordered; `{red, blue, yellow}` is the same as `{yellow, red, blue}`.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Define the set of secondary colors formed by mixing two primary colors.
2. Write the set of primary colors using set-builder notation, such as `{ x | x is a primary color }`.
