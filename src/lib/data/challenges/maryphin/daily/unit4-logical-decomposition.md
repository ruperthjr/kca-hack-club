# Morning Routine Logical Decomposition Challenge

## Overview

This challenge guides you through applying computational thinking to your morning routine. You'll break down the process into logical, manageable steps, identify dependencies, and optimize for efficiency using process decomposition and workflow analysis.

## Objective

Create a clear, realistic sequence of morning routine steps, highlighting dependencies, parallelization opportunities, and time estimates to optimize your workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic morning activities
- Familiarity with logical sequencing and dependencies
- Access to note-taking or diagramming tools
- Ability to estimate time for tasks
- Textbook: Think Like a Programmer by V. Anton Spraul

## Instructions

### Part 1: Identify and List Core Activities

- Brainstorm all essential morning tasks (e.g., wake up, hygiene, breakfast, packing).
- Categorize tasks (personal care, preparation, environment, final checks).

### Part 2: Establish Dependencies and Sequence

- For each task, determine required order and dependencies (e.g., Wake → Brush teeth).
- Express dependencies as simple relations or diagrams.
- Sequence tasks respecting dependencies, locations, and transitions.

### Part 3: Parallelization and Time Optimization

- Identify tasks that can be performed in parallel (e.g., boiling water while packing lunch).
- Annotate parallel tasks clearly.
- Estimate time for each task, including transitions and buffers.
- Create a cumulative time analysis to ensure the routine fits your available window.

## Deliverables

1. Numbered sequential list of morning routine steps with time estimates
2. Dependency diagram (textual or visual)
3. Explicitly annotated parallel tasks
4. Time analysis table or list
5. Brief explanation of optimization choices

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Logical Sequencing      | 30%    | Order respects dependencies and efficiency       |
| Completeness            | 25%    | All essential activities and transitions included|
| Parallelization         | 20%    | Sensible identification of simultaneous tasks    |
| Time Realism            | 15%    | Realistic estimates and buffers                  |
| Clarity                 | 10%    | Steps and dependencies are unambiguous           |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Avoid circular dependencies (A requires B and B requires A)
- Include all transitions and location changes
- Don’t over-optimize at the expense of practicality
- Remember one-off prep tasks (charging devices, weather check)
- Use clear parallel markers and realistic time buffers

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Visualize your routine as a flowchart or swimlane diagram.
2. Propose an alternative routine for a different scenario (e.g., remote work day).

## Submission

Submit a single document (Markdown, PDF, or plain text) containing all deliverables.
