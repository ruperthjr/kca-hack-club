# Morning Routine Logical Decomposition Challenge

Overview
This exercise applies computational thinking to a morning routine. Decompose the process into discrete steps, capture dependencies, and identify opportunities for parallelization and optimization.

Objective
Produce a clear, realistic sequence of steps for an efficient morning routine, flagging which steps must be sequential and which can run in parallel.

Instructions

1. Identify core activities
     - Brainstorm essential tasks without ordering them.
     - Categories to consider:
         - Personal care (wake, hygiene, grooming, dressing)
         - Preparation (breakfast, lunch prep, packing)
         - Environment (bed making, lighting, temperature)
         - Final checks (keys, phone, calendar)

2. Establish dependencies
     - For each pair, decide which must come first.
     - Express dependencies as simple relations (e.g., Wake → Brush teeth).

3. Create a sequential flow
     - Order tasks respecting dependencies, locations, time, and energy.
     - Include transitions between locations (bedroom → bathroom → kitchen).

4. Identify parallelization opportunities
     - Mark tasks that can overlap (e.g., boil water while packing lunch).
     - Use clear indicators (brackets, indentation, or "Parallel:" labels).

5. Add time estimates and buffers
     - Provide per-task time, transition time, and a small buffer for delays.
     - Show cumulative time to validate the routine fits the available window.

Evaluation Criteria
- Logical Sequencing (30%): Order respects dependencies and efficiency.
- Completeness (25%): All essential activities and transitions included.
- Parallelization (20%): Sensible identification of simultaneous tasks.
- Time Realism (15%): Realistic estimates and buffers.
- Clarity (10%): Steps and dependencies are unambiguous.

Common Mistakes
- Circular dependencies (A requires B and B requires A)
- Omitting transitions or location changes
- Over-optimizing without human considerations (fatigue, choices)
- Forgetting one-off prep tasks (charging devices, weather check)

Real-World Applications
- Workflow design and optimization
- Project task sequencing
- UX flow mapping
- Algorithm and process design

Submission Format
Submit one document (Markdown, PDF, or plain text) containing:
- Sequential Step List: Numbered steps in optimal order (include timings)
- Dependency Diagram: Textual or visual representation (e.g., A → B)
- Parallel Tasks: Explicitly listed or annotated
- Time Analysis: Table or list with per-task and cumulative times

Example (concise)
MORNING ROUTINE: 6:30 AM — 7:20 AM

SEQUENTIAL STEPS:
1. Wake & disable alarm (2 min)
2. Drink water + stretch (3 min)
3. Shower & hygiene (12 min)
     [Parallel: Start kettle / quick phone check for urgent messages]
4. Dress (5 min)
5. Prepare/eat breakfast (12 min)
     [Parallel: Pack lunch / check calendar]
6. Gather belongings & final checks (6 min)

DEPENDENCIES:
- Wake → Drink water → Shower → Dress → Breakfast → Final checks
- Kettle can start during Shower; lunch packing can overlap with Breakfast

TIME ANALYSIS:
- Total core time: 40 min
- Transitions & buffers: 8–10 min
- Final window: 48–50 min

Tips for scoring higher
- Include both a sequential list and an explicit dependency representation
- Use clear parallel markers and realistic buffers
- Explain trade-offs (e.g., longer shower vs. reduced breakfast time)

Good luck — keep it practical and human-centered.
