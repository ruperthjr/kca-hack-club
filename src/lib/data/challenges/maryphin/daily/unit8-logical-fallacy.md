# Logical Fallacy Detection in Social Media

## Overview

This challenge develops your ability to critically evaluate arguments in digital spaces by identifying logical fallacies in real social media posts. You'll strengthen your reasoning skills, learn to recognize persuasive but flawed arguments, and practice constructing valid alternatives.

## Objective

Find a recent social media post containing a logical fallacy, classify the fallacy, analyze its persuasive impact, and rewrite the argument using sound reasoning.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with common logical fallacies
- Access to social media (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc.)
- Ability to capture screenshots or copy text
- Basic Markdown or PDF editing skills

## Instructions

### Part 1: Find a Fallacious Social Media Post

- Search for a recent post that contains a logical fallacy (e.g., Ad Hominem, Straw Man, False Dichotomy, Appeal to Emotion, Bandwagon, etc.).
- Capture a screenshot or copy the exact text.
- Note the platform, date, and context.

### Part 2: Identify and Analyze the Fallacy

- Specify the type of fallacy using formal taxonomy.
- Explain why the argument is fallacious, referencing the relevant portion.
- Discuss how the fallacy persuades the audience and what biases or emotions it exploits.
- Consider how platform features may encourage this type of reasoning.

### Part 3: Construct a Valid Alternative Argument

- Rewrite the argument on the same topic using valid reasoning and evidence.
- Avoid fallacious techniques while maintaining clarity and persuasiveness.

## Deliverables

1. Screenshot or text of the original post with platform and date
2. Written analysis identifying and explaining the fallacy
3. Persuasion and context analysis
4. Valid alternative argument
5. Brief reflection (2-3 sentences) on what you learned

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fallacy Identification  | 30%    | Correct classification and explanation           |
| Analysis Depth          | 25%    | Insightful analysis of reasoning and persuasion  |
| Context Understanding   | 20%    | Consideration of platform and audience           |
| Alternative Construction| 15%    | Valid, well-structured alternative argument      |
| Clarity                 | 10%    | Clear, organized, and concise writing            |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Focus on argument structure, not just tone or style
- Avoid confusing weak arguments with actual fallacies
- Provide specific evidence from the post
- Don't create straw man versions of the argument
- Consider the influence of platform norms

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Analyze a post with multiple fallacies and classify each one
2. Compare how the same fallacy appears across different platforms
