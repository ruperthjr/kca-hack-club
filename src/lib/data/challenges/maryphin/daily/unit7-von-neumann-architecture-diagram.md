# Von Neumann Architecture: Diagram and Components

## Overview

The Von Neumann architecture, introduced in 1945, is the foundational model for most modern computers. It features a single memory space for both instructions and data, enabling flexible and efficient program execution. Understanding this architecture is essential for grasping how computers process information and execute programs.

## Objective

Draw and label a clear diagram of the Von Neumann architecture, including its five major components and the direction of data and control flow.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of computer systems
- Access to drawing tools (digital or pen and paper)
- Ability to scan or export your diagram

## Instructions

### Part 1: Research the Components

- Identify the five classic components:
    1. **Memory** (stores data and instructions)
    2. **Control Unit** (decodes instructions, directs operations)
    3. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** (performs arithmetic and logic)
    4. **Input** (receives data from outside)
    5. **Output** (sends data to outside)
- Note: The Control Unit and ALU together form the **CPU**.

### Part 2: Sketch the Diagram

- Place **Memory** at the center or top.
- Draw the **CPU** (showing Control Unit and ALU) connected to Memory.
- Connect **Input** and **Output** to the CPU.
- Use arrows to indicate:
    - Data flow (solid lines)
    - Control signals (dashed lines)
- Label the **address bus**, **data bus**, and **control bus**.

### Part 3: Label and Describe

- Clearly label every component and bus.
- Add a short caption explaining the purpose and significance of the architecture.

## Deliverables

1. A labeled diagram (digital or scanned) showing CPU, memory, input/output, and buses
2. A brief paragraph describing how instructions and data are processed in this model

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria              | Weight | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Correct components    | 40%    | All five components are present and correctly labeled     |
| Connections           | 30%    | Arrows show appropriate direction of data/control flow    |
| Clarity               | 30%    | Diagram is neat, labels are readable, caption is clear    |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Always include and label the buses (address, data, control)
- Remember: memory holds both instructions and data
- Avoid mixing in Harvard architecture (separate memories)
- Make sure all arrows are clearly drawn and labeled
- Keep your diagram neat and readable

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Add a program counter (PC) and instruction register (IR) to your diagram
2. In one sentence, explain the Von Neumann bottleneck

## Submission

Upload your diagram (image or PDF) and your explanatory paragraph as instructed.
