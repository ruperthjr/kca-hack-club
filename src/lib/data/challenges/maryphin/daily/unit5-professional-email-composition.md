# Professional Email Composition Challenge

## Overview

This challenge focuses on crafting a professional email to request a meeting with a professor. You'll practice academic communication etiquette, clear request formulation, and proper email structure.

## Objective

Draft a complete, professional email to Professor Johnson requesting a 20-minute appointment to discuss your course project, including all necessary details and demonstrating proper academic tone.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Subject Line Creation

Create a subject line that is:
- Specific and informative
- Includes your course name/number
- Indicates the purpose briefly
- Easy to prioritize/filter

**Avoid:** Vague subjects like "Meeting" or "Question"
**Preferred:** "COMP 101: Meeting Request re: Final Project - Daniel Smith"

### Step 2: Salutation and Opening

Begin with appropriate formal address:
- Use proper title (Professor, Dr.)
- Include last name
- Reference the course if applicable
- Brief pleasantry (optional but professional)

**Example:** "Dear Professor Johnson," followed by "I hope this email finds you well."

### Step 3: Context and Purpose

Clearly state:
- Your identity and course enrollment
- The specific reason for meeting
- Why this discussion is necessary
- What you hope to achieve

**Include:**
- Course name and section
- Project/topic needing discussion
- Brief background (2-3 sentences max)
- Your specific questions or areas needing clarification

### Step 4: Meeting Logistics

Provide:
- Requested meeting duration (15-30 minutes typical)
- Your availability (offer 2-3 specific time windows)
- Preferred format (in-person, virtual, hybrid)
- Location suggestion if in-person

**Important:** Make it easy for the professor to respond by providing clear options.

### Step 5: Preparation and Attachments

Mention:
- Any materials you'll bring/prepare
- Attachments included with email
- What the professor might want to review
- Your readiness to adjust based on their preference

### Step 6: Professional Closing

Include:
- Appreciation for their time
- Confirmation of next steps
- Professional sign-off
- Complete contact information

**Example:** "Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response."

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be assessed on:

1.  **Professional Tone (25%):** Appropriate formality and respect for academic hierarchy
2.  **Clarity of Request (20%):** Specific, unambiguous meeting purpose and logistics
3.  **Completeness (20%):** All necessary information included without redundancy
4.  **Conciseness (15%):** Efficient communication without unnecessary details
5.  **Formatting (10%):** Proper email structure, spacing, and visual organization
6.  **Grammar/Spelling (10%):** Error-free writing with proper academic language

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using casual language or abbreviations (u, thx, etc.)
- Failing to identify yourself and your course clearly
- Making demands instead of requests
- Providing unavailable or unreasonable time options
- Writing overly long emails without clear structure
- Forgetting to include contact information
- Sending during unreasonable hours (late night/weekends)
- Not proofreading for typos and errors
- Missing subject line or using inappropriate one
- Assuming immediate response without allowing reasonable time

## Real-World Application

Professional email skills are essential for:
- Academic correspondence with faculty and administrators
- Business communication with colleagues and supervisors
- Client and stakeholder communication
- Job application follow-ups
- Networking and professional relationship building
- Remote work communication
- Formal request submissions in organizational settings

## Submission Format

Submit a complete email draft with the following sections clearly labeled:
- **Subject Line:** [Your proposed subject]
- **Salutation:** [Formal greeting]
- **Body Content:** [3-4 concise paragraphs]
    - Introduction and context
    - Meeting purpose and value
    - Logistics and options
    - Preparation and next steps
- **Closing:** [Professional sign-off]
- **Signature:** [Your name, student ID, course, contact info]

**Format:** Plain text, PDF, or properly formatted email file
**Length:** 150-250 words maximum
**Context:** Assume you're in COMP 101 (Introduction to Programming) and need to discuss your final project proposal

## Sample Structure Framework

```text
Subject: COMP 101: Appointment Request - Final Project Discussion

Dear Professor Johnson,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Daniel Smith, and I'm a student in your COMP 101 Tuesday/Thursday 10 AM section.

I'm writing to request a brief meeting to discuss my final project proposal for the course. I've chosen to develop a personal habit tracker application and would appreciate your feedback on my technical approach before I begin implementation.

Would you have 20 minutes available next week for a meeting? I'm available:
- Tuesday between 2-4 PM
- Wednesday between 10 AM-12 PM
- Thursday between 1-3 PM

I'm happy to meet in your office or via Zoom, whichever is more convenient. I've attached my initial project outline for your review.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Daniel Smith
