# Computer Hardware Components Documentation Challenge

## Overview

Understanding computer hardware is essential for anyone in technology. In this challenge, you'll create a professional document that catalogs and explains the main hardware components of a modern computer, combining research, technical writing, and document formatting skills.

## Objective

Produce a comprehensive, well-formatted Word document that identifies at least 10 major computer hardware components, describes their functions, includes images, and demonstrates professional formatting.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Microsoft Word or Google Docs
- Internet access for research and images
- Understanding of computer hardware fundamentals

## Instructions

### Part 1: Research and Gather Information

- Identify and research these 10 components: CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Hard Drive/SSD, GPU, PSU, Computer Case, Cooling System, Input Devices, Output Devices.
- For each, collect: function, interaction with other components, key specs, and (optionally) price range.

### Part 2: Structure and Format the Document

- Set up your document: Letter size, 1-inch margins, Arial/Calibri 11pt, headings 14pt, line spacing 1.15–1.5.
- Required sections: Title Page, Table of Contents, Introduction, Hardware Components (with images and details), Comparison Table, Conclusion, References.
- Use Heading styles for all section titles and subsections.

### Part 3: Populate Content and Finalize

- For each component, add a subsection with an image, function, technical details, role in the system, and an example model.
- Create a comparison table summarizing all components.
- Write a clear introduction and conclusion.
- Add references in APA or MLA format.
- Insert page numbers (footer) and document title (header).
- Proofread and ensure consistent formatting.

## Deliverables

1. Word document: `hardware-components-[yourname].docx`
2. PDF export: `hardware-components-[yourname].pdf`
3. All images embedded and properly captioned
4. Well-formatted comparison table
5. References section with citations

## Evaluation Criteria
