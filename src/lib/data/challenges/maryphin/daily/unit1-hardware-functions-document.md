# Computer Hardware Components Documentation Challenge

## Overview

Professional technical documentation is a critical skill for anyone working in technology. This challenge asks you to create a comprehensive, well-formatted Word document that catalogs the major hardware components found in modern computers and explains their functions.

You will research, organize, and present information about hardware components in a format that could be used as a reference guide for someone learning about computer systems. This exercise combines technical knowledge with document formatting skills.

## Objective

Create a professional Microsoft Word document that identifies at least 10 major computer hardware components, provides clear descriptions of their functions, includes visual representations, and demonstrates proper document formatting techniques.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Research Hardware Components (15 minutes)

Identify and research these 10 essential hardware components:

**Required Components:**
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2. Random Access Memory (RAM)
3. Motherboard
4. Hard Drive / Solid State Drive
5. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
6. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
7. Computer Case
8. Cooling System (Fans/Heatsinks)
9. Input Devices (Keyboard, Mouse)
10. Output Devices (Monitor, Speakers)

For each component, gather:
- Primary function
- How it interacts with other components
- Common specifications or types
- Typical price range (optional)

### Step 2: Create Document Structure (10 minutes)

**Document Setup:**
- Page size: Letter (8.5" x 11")
- Margins: 1 inch all sides
- Font: Arial or Calibri, 11pt for body, 14pt for headings
- Line spacing: 1.15 or 1.5

**Required Sections:**
1. Title Page
2. Table of Contents (auto-generated)
3. Introduction
4. Hardware Components (main section)
5. Component Comparison Table
6. Conclusion
7. References

### Step 3: Title Page

Create a professional title page with:
- Document title: "Computer Hardware Components Guide"
- Your name
- Course: Computer Applications
- Date: February 9, 2026
- Center-aligned text
- Attractive font sizes and spacing

### Step 4: Table of Contents

Insert an automatic table of contents:
- References > Table of Contents > Automatic Table
- Ensure all headings use Heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2)

### Step 5: Introduction Section

Write a 3-4 paragraph introduction covering:
- Purpose of the document
- Why understanding hardware is important
- Overview of what components will be covered
- How components work together as a system

### Step 6: Hardware Components Section

For EACH of the 10 components, create a subsection with:

**Component Name** (Heading 2)
- **Image:** Insert a clear, labeled image (at least 200x200 pixels)
- **Function:** 2-3 sentences explaining primary purpose
- **Technical Details:** Key specifications or variations
- **Role in System:** How it connects to other components
- **Example:** Specific model or type

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use Heading 2 for component names
- Use bold for labels (Function, Technical Details, etc.)
- Insert images with captions
- Maintain consistent spacing

### Step 7: Component Comparison Table

Create a table comparing all 10 components:

| Component | Primary Function | Typical Cost Range | Upgradeable? |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| CPU | Processing instructions | $100-$500 | Yes |
| RAM | Temporary data storage | $30-$150 | Yes |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Table Formatting:**
- Use Table Design > Table Style (choose professional style)
- Header row should be bold with background color
- Center-align text in columns 3 and 4

### Step 8: Conclusion

Write a 2-3 paragraph conclusion:
- Summarize importance of each component
- Explain how they work together
- Mention considerations when building or buying a computer

### Step 9: References

List all sources used:
- Textbook citation
- Websites referenced
- Use proper citation format (APA or MLA)

### Step 10: Final Formatting

Apply these professional touches:
- **Page Numbers:** Insert footer with page numbers (bottom center)
- **Header:** Add document title to header (except title page)
- **Styles:** Ensure consistent use of Heading 1, Heading 2, Normal
- **Images:** Ensure all images have captions and are properly sized
- **Spacing:** Check that spacing is consistent throughout
- **Spell Check:** Run spelling and grammar check

## Evaluation Criteria
