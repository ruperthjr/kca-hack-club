# Algorithmic Thinking: Making a Cup of Tea

## Overview

This challenge introduces algorithmic thinking by guiding you to break down the everyday process of making a cup of tea into clear, logical steps. You'll practice decomposition, sequencing, and precision—essential skills for problem-solving in computing and beyond.

## Objective

Write a detailed, step-by-step algorithm for preparing a cup of tea with a tea bag, suitable for someone with no prior experience.

## Prerequisites

- None.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Decompose the Task

- Identify and list the main sub-tasks (e.g., boiling water, preparing the cup, steeping the tea).
- Specify the **inputs** (water, tea bag, cup, kettle, spoon) and the **output** (a cup of tea).

### Part 2: Write the Algorithm

- Create a numbered list of explicit steps, starting from the very beginning (e.g., “Fill the kettle with water”).
- Assume the user has no prior knowledge; avoid ambiguity.

### Part 3: Refine for Clarity

- Review your steps to remove any vagueness.
- Add conditional steps if necessary (e.g., “If the tea bag has a tag, hang it outside the cup”).

## Deliverables

1. A text document with a numbered list of at least 10 instructions.
2. A short reflection on which step was hardest to describe clearly.
3. Any supporting notes or diagrams (optional).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria      | Weight | Description                                              |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Completeness  | 40%    | All essential stages are covered (preparation, boiling, steeping, serving). |
| Precision     | 30%    | Steps are unambiguous and can be followed literally.    |
| Structure     | 30%    | Steps are logically ordered and clearly numbered.       |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Don’t skip steps like “remove the tea bag.”
- Avoid vague verbs; be specific (e.g., “boil” instead of “warm up”).
- Consider edge cases, such as checking if there is enough water.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Write a parallel algorithm for making coffee using a French press.
2. Translate your algorithm into pseudocode or a flowchart.

## Submission

Submit your algorithm and reflection as a text document.
