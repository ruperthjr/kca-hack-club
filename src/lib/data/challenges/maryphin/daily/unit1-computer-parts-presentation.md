# Computer Parts Presentation with PowerPoint

## Overview

This challenge introduces you to creating professional presentations using PowerPoint or similar tools. You'll combine digital literacy with foundational computer hardware knowledge to communicate technical concepts visually and clearly.

## Objective

Create a 4-slide presentation that summarizes the main parts of a computer—input devices, output devices, and processing/storage components—using effective design and visuals.

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer skills
- Access to presentation software (PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote)
- Ability to search for and insert images

## Instructions

### Part 1: Plan Your Slides

- **Slide 1 – Title:** Add a descriptive title, your name, and a relevant image or icon.
- **Slide 2 – Input Devices:** List and briefly describe 2–3 input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner).
- **Slide 3 – Output Devices:** List and briefly describe 2–3 output devices (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers).
- **Slide 4 – Processing & Storage:** Explain the roles of the CPU, RAM, and storage (hard drive or SSD).

### Part 2: Design and Build

- Select a clean, professional theme.
- Use bullet points for clarity.
- Insert at least one image or diagram per slide.
- Apply consistent fonts, colors, and alignment.

### Part 3: Finalize and Export

- Review for spelling and grammar.
- Save as `ComputerParts_YourName.pptx` (or equivalent).
- Optionally export as PDF for sharing.

## Deliverables

1. A 4-slide presentation file (.pptx, .key, or .gslides)
2. Slides covering title, input, output, and processing/storage
3. Consistent design and at least one image per slide

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria           | Weight | Description                                             |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Content accuracy   | 40%    | Correct identification and description of computer parts |
| Slide design       | 30%    | Professional layout, readable text, appropriate images   |
| Organization       | 30%    | Logical flow, no errors, meets 4-slide requirement       |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Limit slides to 3–5 bullet points each
- Use large, readable fonts (titles ≥32pt, body ≥20pt)
- Avoid clutter and excessive text
- Remember: CPU ≠ computer case

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Add a fifth slide comparing desktops and laptops
2. Record a 1-minute narration for each slide

## Submission

Upload your completed presentation file as instructed.
