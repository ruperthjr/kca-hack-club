# Production-Ready Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

Create a professional, interactive dashboard that transforms raw datasets into actionable insights. You'll use Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit or Dash to build a web app capable of data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, filtering, and export—skills essential for modern data engineering and analytics.

## Objective

Design, implement, and deploy a data dashboard that supports real-world datasets, offers at least five interactive visualization types, enables data filtering and export, and is accessible to non-technical users.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Familiarity with Pandas and basic data analysis
- Git and GitHub account
- Access to a dataset (CSV/Excel/JSON, 1000+ rows)
- Modern web browser

## Instructions

### Part 1: Data Ingestion & Processing

- Select a dataset (e.g., COVID-19, stock prices, sales, weather, or your own).
- Load data using Pandas, handling CSV/Excel/JSON formats.
- Clean data: handle missing values, convert types, parse dates, deduplicate.
- Engineer features (e.g., year, month, category).

### Part 2: Visualization & Interactivity

- Implement at least five visualization types (line, bar, scatter, pie/donut, heatmap, etc.) using Plotly.
- Add interactive filters: date range, category selection, search, sliders.
- Display key metrics (count, sum, mean, growth, custom KPIs).

### Part 3: Export, Documentation & Deployment

- Enable export of filtered data (CSV, Excel).
- Document your code and usage in a clear README.
- Deploy your dashboard using Streamlit Cloud or Dash deployment.
- Record a short demo video or presentation.

## Deliverables

1. Deployed interactive dashboard (URL)
2. Source code repository (GitHub)
3. At least five interactive visualizations
4. Data export functionality (CSV/Excel)
5. Comprehensive README documentation
6. Demo video or presentation

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Data Processing         | 20%    | Robust loading, cleaning, and feature engineering|
| Visualizations          | 30%    | >=5 types, clarity, interactivity                |
| Interactivity           | 20%    | Filters, responsiveness, user experience         |
| Features & Exports      | 15%    | Data export, KPIs, search                        |
| Code Quality & Docs     | 10%    | Clean, modular code, clear README                |
| Deployment              | 5%     | Live, accessible dashboard                       |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Start with a clean, well-structured dataset.
- Modularize your code for data loading, processing, and visualization.
- Test filters and exports with edge cases (empty, large, or malformed data).
- Avoid hardcoding file paths or column names.
- Document setup and usage clearly in your README.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Add support for uploading custom datasets via the UI.
2. Implement advanced analytics (regression, moving averages, comparison modes).

## Submission

Submit your GitHub repository link containing:
- Source code and utilities
- Dataset or loading instructions
- README with setup and run instructions
- requirements.txt
- Deployed dashboard URL
- Demo video link
