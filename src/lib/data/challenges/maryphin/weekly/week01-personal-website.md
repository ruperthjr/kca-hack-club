# Personal Portfolio Website: Bio & Project Goals

## Overview

Create a professional, accessible, and responsive three-page portfolio website to introduce yourself, highlight your skills, and outline your project goals. This challenge emphasizes semantic HTML, modern CSS, and deployment best practices.

## Objective

Design, build, and deploy a static portfolio site with a Home, Bio, and Projects page, demonstrating responsive layouts and accessibility.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS
- GitHub account and familiarity with Git
- Text editor (VS Code or similar)
- Web browser for testing

## Instructions

### Part 1: Plan & Gather Content

- Define content for each page:
  - Home: headline, tagline, call-to-action
  - Bio: education, skills, interests
  - Projects: goals, tech stack, ideas
- Collect assets: profile photo, social links, screenshots

### Part 2: Build Semantic HTML Structure

- Use semantic elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- Implement consistent navigation with active state
- Add alt text for images and meta viewport tag

### Part 3: Style & Make Responsive

- Organize CSS using variables and modular files
- Apply mobile-first responsive design with Flexbox/Grid
- Ensure accessible color contrast and focus states
- Test layouts on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Deliverables

1. Three semantic HTML pages: Home, Bio, Projects
2. Responsive design with external CSS
3. Working navigation and accessible markup
4. Deployed site on GitHub Pages (public URL)
5. README with project overview and screenshots
