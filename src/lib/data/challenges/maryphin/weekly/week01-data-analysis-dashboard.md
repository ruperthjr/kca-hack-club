# COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This challenge guides you through building a professional, interactive dashboard in Excel or Google Sheets using real COVID-19 data. You'll practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, developing skills essential for business intelligence and data-driven decision making.

## Objective

Create a dynamic dashboard that analyzes COVID-19 case data, visualizes trends and patterns, and enables users to explore insights interactively through filters and slicers.

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate knowledge of Excel or Google Sheets
- Basic statistics (mean, rates, moving averages)
- Ability to download and handle CSV files

## Instructions

### Part 1: Data Acquisition & Preparation

- Download a COVID-19 dataset (see Resources) with at least 6 months of data for 10+ countries.
- Clean the data: remove unnecessary columns, handle missing values, standardize date and country formats.
- Add calculated columns: daily new cases, case fatality rate, recovery rate, 7-day moving average.

### Part 2: Pivot Table Analysis

- Create at least 4 pivot tables:
  - Country summary (totals, averages, peaks)
  - Time series (monthly/weekly trends)
  - Comparative analysis (rates by country/region)
  - Regional aggregation (continent/region totals)
- Use calculated fields, slicers, and conditional formatting.

### Part 3: Visualization & Dashboard Design

- Build at least 5 chart types: line, bar, stacked area, scatter, heat map, or combo chart.
- Assemble a dashboard layout with KPIs, slicers, and interactive elements.
- Ensure clear titles, legends, and accessible color schemes.
- Document your methodology and insights in a separate tab or report.

## Deliverables

1. Spreadsheet file (.xlsx or Google Sheets link) with:
   - Cleaned data tab
   - Pivot tables
   - Dashboard with visualizations
   - Documentation tab
2. 2-3 page analysis report (PDF) with key findings and screenshots
3. Dashboard user guide

## Evaluation Criteria

| Data Preparation        | 20%    | Clean, structured data and accurate calculations |
| Pivot Table Analysis    | 25%    | Comprehensive, insightful summaries              |
| Visualization Quality   | 25%    | Clear, effective, and interactive charts         |
| Dashboard Usability     | 15%    | Intuitive layout and navigation                  |
| Insight & Reporting     | 15%    | Well-presented, meaningful findings              |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Spend time cleaning your data before analysis
- Avoid misleading charts (e.g., truncated axes)
- Use consistent formatting and clear labels
- Document your methodology and sources
- Test all interactive features before submission

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Add forecasting using Excel's built-in tools
2. Implement VBA macros or Google Apps Script for automation

## Submission

Submit your spreadsheet file (or shareable link), analysis report, and user guide as specified by your instructor or platform.
