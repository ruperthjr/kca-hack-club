# Annotated Bibliography for Research Methodology in Computing

## Overview

Developing an annotated bibliography is a foundational skill for computing researchers, enabling critical engagement with scholarly literature. This challenge guides you through selecting, citing, and evaluating a research methodology book, emphasizing its relevance to computing research and academic writing.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will produce a well-formatted annotated bibliography entry that summarizes, critiques, and reflects on a research methodology book’s value for computing research.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of annotated bibliographies and their purpose.
- Access to a research methodology book from the provided list.
- Familiarity with APA 7th Edition citation style.
- Ability to use a citation management tool.
- Basic academic writing skills.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Select and Cite a Methodology Book

1. Choose a book from the resources list.
2. Gather complete publication details: author(s), title, edition, publisher, year, ISBN.
3. Format the citation in APA 7th Edition.

### Part 2: Write the Annotation

1. Summarize the book’s scope and purpose (1–2 sentences).
2. Describe its structure and key features (1–2 sentences).
3. Critically evaluate its strengths, weaknesses, and relevance to computing research (2–3 sentences).
4. Reflect on how you will use the book in your own research (1 sentence).
5. Keep the annotation between 150–200 words.

### Part 3: Format and Submit

1. Place the citation at the top, followed by the annotation paragraph.
2. Use a hanging indent for the citation if possible.
3. Save your work as `Unit1_AnnotatedBib.[docx|pdf|md]`.

## Deliverables

1. Annotated bibliography entry (citation + annotation).
2. Properly formatted APA citation.
3. Brief reflection on the source’s relevance to your research.
