# As-Is Process Mapping: Library Book Borrowing

## Overview

Understanding and documenting current business processes is essential for effective improvement. In this challenge, you will create an as-is process map of the KCA University library's book borrowing workflow. This exercise builds your skills in process modeling, analysis, and communication—key competencies for business analysts and system designers.

## Objective

Produce a detailed process map that visually represents every step, actor, and decision point involved in borrowing a physical book from the KCA University library, and provide a concise written analysis of the process.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with flowchart or BPMN symbols (start/end, process, decision, connector)
- Access to or knowledge of academic library borrowing procedures
- Ability to use a diagramming tool (digital or paper)
- Basic process analysis concepts

## Instructions

### Part 1: Identify Actors and Steps

- List all actors (e.g., Student, Librarian, Library System).
- Outline the main steps from entering the library to exiting with a borrowed book.
- Note key decision points (e.g., book availability, outstanding fines).

### Part 2: Choose Notation and Tool

- Select a process mapping notation (flowchart or BPMN recommended).
- Use a digital tool (draw.io, Lucidchart, Miro) or paper.
- If using swimlanes, assign each actor to a separate lane.

### Part 3: Draw and Annotate the Process Map

- Begin with a clear "Start" node.
- Sequence all activities and connect them with arrows.
- Add decision diamonds for conditions (e.g., "Is the book available?").
- Include exceptions (e.g., book not found, system offline).
- End with an "End" node when the process is complete.
- Label all steps, actors, and decision outcomes.

## Deliverables

1. Process map image (PNG, JPG, or PDF) with all steps, actors, and decisions clearly labeled
2. Written explanation (100–200 words) describing the process flow, scope, and assumptions
3. List of identified bottlenecks or inefficiencies
4. Annotated diagram highlighting decision points and exceptions
5. Submission files named as specified in the instructions

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria         | Weight | Description                                                      |
|------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Completeness     | 40%    | All major steps, actors, and decision points are included        |
| Accuracy         | 25%    | Process map reflects a realistic library borrowing workflow      |
| Clarity & Notation | 20%  | Correct use of symbols; diagram is neat and easy to follow       |
| Analysis         | 15%    | Written explanation identifies at least one inefficiency         |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use swimlanes to clarify actor responsibilities
- Clearly label all arrows and decision outcomes (Yes/No)
- Avoid excessive detail—focus on the main borrowing path and common exceptions
- Keep symbols consistent throughout the diagram
- Don’t forget to include start and end points

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Create a "to-be" process map suggesting improvements (e.g., self-service kiosks)
2. Annotate each activity with estimated duration (e.g., 1 min, 5 min)

## Submission

Upload your process map image and written explanation to your GitHub repository, Google Drive, or LMS. Ensure all text is legible and files are named: `Day4_Unit8_ProcessMap.[png|pdf]` and `Day4_Unit8_Explanation.md`.
