# Customer Interview Mastery: Applying The Mom Test

## Overview

Effective customer interviews are essential for building products people actually need. The Mom Test framework helps you avoid biased questions and extract honest, actionable insights by focusing on real experiences and problems. In this challenge, you'll practice these skills by interviewing a classmate, analyzing your findings, and reflecting on your technique.

## Objective

Conduct a 10–15 minute customer interview using The Mom Test principles to uncover a real problem, document your findings, and reflect on your interview approach.

## Prerequisites

- Read the core chapters of *The Mom Test* (especially on avoiding bad data)
- Prepare an interview script with open-ended, non-leading questions
- Arrange a partner who has not read The Mom Test

## Instructions

### Part 1: Preparation

1. Select a broad problem area (e.g., studying, commuting, fitness).
2. Draft 5–7 open-ended questions focused on past behavior and current processes.
3. Avoid mentioning any solution or product ideas.

### Part 2: Conduct the Interview

1. Interview your partner for 10–15 minutes, recording or taking detailed notes (with permission).
2. Use your script as a guide, but keep the conversation natural.
3. Probe deeper with follow-up questions like “Why?” or “Can you tell me more?”
4. Let the interviewee do most of the talking.

### Part 3: Analyze and Reflect

1. Review your notes and identify:
     - The core problem(s) discussed
     - Current solutions or workarounds
     - Emotional signals and key quotes
     - Any strong commitments or signals of real need
2. Write a one-page summary of your findings.
3. Reflect in ~150 words on how you applied The Mom Test, what worked, and what you’d improve.

## Deliverables

1. Raw interview notes (typed or scanned)
2. One-page summary of findings (problem, alternatives, key quotes)
3. 150-word reflection on your interview technique

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Avoid “Would you…” or hypothetical questions
- Don’t pitch your idea during the interview
- Listen for pain points, not just routines
- Watch for real commitments (offers to help, introductions, etc.)
- Keep interviews focused and concise

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

2. Interview someone from a different background and compare findings
