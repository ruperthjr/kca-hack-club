# Literature Review Matrix Challenge

## Overview

In this challenge, you'll develop systematic literature review skills by comparing 5 research papers in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. You'll create a structured matrix that allows for easy comparison of methodologies, findings, and contributions.

## Objective

Create a comprehensive literature review matrix that compares 5 HCI research papers across multiple dimensions including research questions, methodologies, key findings, and limitations.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Paper Selection

Select 5 HCI research papers from the last 5 years that focus on a specific topic such as:
- Mobile interface design
- Accessibility in digital products
- Voice user interfaces
- Gesture-based interactions
- AR/VR user experience

**Criteria for paper selection:**
- Published in reputable venues (CHI, CSCW, UIST, etc.)
- Peer-reviewed
- Full research papers (not short papers or posters)
- Recent (2019-2024)

### Step 2: Create the Matrix

Build a table with the following columns:

**Basic Information:**
- Paper Title
- Authors
- Year
- Publication Venue
- Citation Count

**Research Design:**
- Research Question/Objective
- Methodology (Qualitative/Quantitative/Mixed)
- Sample Size
- Data Collection Methods
- Analysis Techniques

**Results:**
- Key Findings
- Contributions to HCI
- Limitations
- Future Work Suggestions

### Step 3: Analysis

After completing the matrix, write a 500-word analysis covering:

1. **Common Themes:** What patterns emerge across the papers?
2. **Methodological Approaches:** Which methods are most common? Why?
3. **Research Gaps:** What questions remain unanswered?
4. **Evolution:** How has the research evolved over time?

### Step 4: Documentation

Organize your submission with:
- The completed matrix (Excel, Google Sheets, or Markdown table)
- Analysis document
- Properly formatted bibliography using APA or IEEE citation style

## Example Matrix Structure

```markdown
| Paper | Authors | Year | Venue | Research Question | Method | Sample | Key Finding | Limitation |
|-------|---------|------|-------|-------------------|--------|--------|-------------|------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Evaluation Criteria

Your work will be assessed on:

1. **Paper Selection** (20%): Relevance and quality of chosen papers
2. **Matrix Completeness** (30%): All required fields filled with accurate information
3. **Analysis Depth** (30%): Insightful synthesis of findings
4. **Academic Rigor** (20%): Proper citations and scholarly writing

## Tips for Success

- Start by reading abstracts to ensure papers fit your chosen theme
- Take detailed notes while reading each paper
- Look for contradictions or confirmations across studies
- Consider how each paper builds on or challenges previous work
- Use your citation manager from the start to avoid scrambling later

## Stretch Goals

If you complete the basic challenge, consider:
- Expanding to 10 papers for a more comprehensive review
- Creating a visual concept map showing relationships between papers
- Writing a mini systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines
- Identifying 3 potential research questions for future study

## Submission

Submit your completed matrix and analysis document to your repository with clear filenames:
- `literature-review-matrix.xlsx` (or `.csv`, `.md`)
- `literature-analysis.pdf` (or `.md`)
- `references.bib` (if using BibTeX)

## Resources for Deep Dive

- **Systematic Reviews in HCI:** Look up papers on methodology in CHI proceedings
- **Research Design:** "Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction" by Lazar et al.
- **Citation Practices:** APA 7th edition guidelines or IEEE citation guide

Good luck with your literature review!
