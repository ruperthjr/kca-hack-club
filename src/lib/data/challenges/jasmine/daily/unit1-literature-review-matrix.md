# Literature Review Matrix Challenge

## Overview

This challenge guides you through conducting a systematic literature review in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). You'll select recent research papers, extract key information, and synthesize your findings using a structured comparison matrix—an essential skill for academic research and critical analysis in computing.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will develop the ability to systematically compare HCI research papers, identify patterns and gaps, and communicate your findings through a structured matrix and analytical summary.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic HCI concepts
- Access to academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library)
- Spreadsheet or markdown editing skills
- Experience using citation management tools (e.g., Zotero)

## Instructions

### Part 1: Select Relevant Papers

1. Choose 5 peer-reviewed HCI research papers published between 2019–2024 on a focused topic (e.g., accessibility, mobile interfaces, AR/VR, gesture interaction).
2. Ensure papers are full-length, from reputable venues (CHI, CSCW, UIST, etc.).

### Part 2: Build the Literature Review Matrix

1. Create a table with these columns:
   - Paper Title
   - Authors
   - Year
   - Venue
   - Citation Count
   - Research Question/Objective
   - Methodology (Qualitative/Quantitative/Mixed)
   - Sample Size
   - Data Collection Methods
   - Analysis Techniques
   - Key Findings
   - Contributions to HCI
   - Limitations
   - Future Work Suggestions
2. Fill in the matrix with details from each paper.

### Part 3: Analyze and Synthesize

1. Write a 500-word analysis covering:
   - Common themes and patterns across papers
   - Methodological trends and their rationale
   - Research gaps and unanswered questions
   - Evolution of research in your chosen topic

## Deliverables

1. Completed literature review matrix (Excel, Google Sheets, or Markdown table)
2. 500-word analysis document summarizing findings and gaps
3. Properly formatted bibliography (APA or IEEE style)

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Paper Selection         | 20%    | Relevance, quality, and recency of chosen papers |
| Matrix Completeness     | 30%    | All required fields filled with accurate details |
| Analysis Depth          | 30%    | Insightful synthesis and critical evaluation     |
| Academic Rigor          | 20%    | Proper citations and scholarly writing           |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Start with abstracts to filter relevant papers quickly
- Take detailed notes while reading each paper
- Avoid including short papers or posters
- Double-check citation formatting
- Don’t overlook limitations or future work sections

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Expand your matrix to 10 papers for a broader review
2. Create a visual concept map showing relationships between studies

## Submission

Submit your matrix and analysis document to your repository with clear filenames:
- `literature-review-matrix.xlsx` (or `.csv`, `.md`)
- `literature-analysis.pdf` (or `.md`)
- `references.bib` (if using BibTeX)
