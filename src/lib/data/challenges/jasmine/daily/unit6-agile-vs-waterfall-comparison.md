# Agile vs Waterfall: Methodological Comparison

## Overview

Choosing the right development methodology can determine the success or failure of a software project. Waterfall, the traditional plan‑driven model, and Agile, the modern adaptive model, represent two fundamentally different philosophies. This challenge requires you to research, synthesise, and clearly communicate the differences between these approaches – a common interview question and a practical decision every software engineer faces.

## Objective

Produce a well‑structured report (1‑2 pages) that:
- Defines Waterfall and Agile methodologies
- Contrasts their core principles, workflow, and documentation practices
- Discusses when each is most appropriate
- Includes a comparison table for quick reference

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic SDLC stages (requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance)
- No prior industry experience required – this is a research and synthesis task

## Instructions

### Part 1: Research and Gather Information

1. **Waterfall** – Understand its linear, sequential phases, the emphasis on up‑front requirements, and the difficulty of change late in the project.  
2. **Agile** – Understand its iterative nature, the Agile Manifesto (individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, responding to change), and common frameworks (Scrum, Kanban).  
3. **Compare** – Identify at least five dimensions to compare (e.g., requirements, customer involvement, testing, documentation, team size).

### Part 2: Structure Your Report

Organise the report into the following sections:

- **Introduction** – Brief description of why methodology matters.  
- **Waterfall Overview** – Key characteristics, phases, advantages, disadvantages.  
- **Agile Overview** – Key characteristics, roles, ceremonies, advantages, disadvantages.  
- **Comparison Table** – Side‑by‑side comparison of at least 6 criteria.  
- **When to Use Each** – Guidelines for selecting a methodology based on project type, risk, and customer availability.  
- **Conclusion** – Summary of the trade‑offs.

### Part 3: Write and Format

- Use clear headings and bullet points where appropriate.  
- Include the comparison table as a markdown or Word table.  
- Aim for 600‑900 words (1‑2 pages).  
- Cite your sources (at least two references).

## Deliverables

1. **Agile_vs_Waterfall_Report.[pdf|docx|md]** – the complete report.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria             | Weight | Description                                                                    |
|----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy             | 35%    | Both methodologies are described correctly without factual errors.             |
| Depth of Comparison  | 30%    | Compares multiple facets (process, people, work products, adaptability).       |
| Clarity & Structure  | 20%    | Report is logically organised, easy to read, and uses a helpful table.         |
| Critical Analysis    | 15%    | Goes beyond definitions to discuss trade‑offs and suitable contexts.           |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- **Do not treat Agile as a single, monolithic method** – mention Scrum and XP if possible.  
- **Avoid bias** – present both methodologies fairly; Waterfall is not “old and bad”, it is still used in safety‑critical systems.  
- **Be specific** – instead of “Agile is flexible”, say “Agile allows requirements to be reprioritised every sprint.”  
- **Include a concrete example** – e.g., “A mobile app startup might use Agile, while a government air traffic control system might use Waterfall.”  
- **Proofread** – incorrect use of terms like “sprint” or “V‑model” can lose marks.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. **Add a third model** – compare Waterfall and Agile with a hybrid model (e.g., SAFe, RUP).  
2. **Case study** – briefly describe a real project and which methodology you would choose and why.  
3. **Infographic** – create a visual diagram illustrating the two lifecycles.

## Submission

- Upload the report to your LMS or GitHub.  
- If you created an infographic, include it as a separate image file.
