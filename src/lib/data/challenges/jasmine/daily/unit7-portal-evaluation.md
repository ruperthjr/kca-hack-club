# KCA Student Portal Heuristic Evaluation

## Overview

In this challenge, you will perform a heuristic evaluation of a university student portal login page. You’ll identify usability issues using Nielsen’s 10 heuristics, rate their severity, and propose prioritized, actionable improvements. This exercise builds practical skills in UX analysis and prepares you to advocate for user-centered design.

## Objective

Evaluate a login interface, document usability problems, and deliver a clear, prioritized improvement plan based on established heuristics.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of usability and UX fundamentals
- Familiarity with Nielsen’s heuristics
- Access to a sample or hypothetical student portal login page
- Basic skills in documentation and presentation

## Instructions

### Part 1: Define Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics

- Briefly summarize each heuristic in your own words.
- Provide a login page example for each heuristic.

### Part 2: Analyze the Portal Interface

- Review the provided or hypothetical login page.
- List all key interface elements (e.g., fields, buttons, links, images).
- Note any accessibility or usability concerns.

### Part 3: Heuristic Violations Matrix

- Create a table listing:
  - Heuristic violated
  - Interface element
  - Problem description
  - Severity (0–4)
  - Evidence (screenshot or observation)

### Part 4: Deep Dive on Top Issues

- Select the three most severe usability problems.
- For each, analyze:
  - Impact on users
  - Root cause
  - Consequences
  - Annotated screenshot or sketch

### Part 5: Actionable Recommendations

- Propose specific redesigns for each top issue.
- Outline implementation steps and expected benefits.
- Suggest ways to measure improvement.

### Part 6: Improvement Roadmap

- Prioritize fixes into phases (critical, major, enhancements, polish).
- Assign objectives, resources, and success metrics for each phase.

## Deliverables

1. Completed heuristic violations matrix (with severity ratings)
2. Annotated screenshots or sketches for top issues
3. Prioritized list of actionable recommendations
4. Improvement roadmap with phases and metrics
5. Executive summary for stakeholders

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Heuristic Application   | 30%    | Correct mapping and justified severity ratings   |
| Analysis Depth          | 30%    | Focused analysis on top issues and user impact   |
| Recommendations Quality | 25%    | Actionable, clear, and prioritized improvements  |
| Presentation            | 15%    | Structured, clear tables and roadmap             |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use real screenshots or clear sketches for evidence
- Justify severity ratings with user impact, not just opinion
- Prioritize fixes that address the most critical issues first
- Avoid vague recommendations—be specific and actionable
- Don’t overlook accessibility and mobile usability

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Conduct a quick usability test with peers and summarize findings
2. Run an automated accessibility scan and report results

## Submission

Submit your completed matrix, annotated screenshots, recommendations, roadmap, and executive summary as a single PDF or markdown file via your course portal or designated submission system.
