# Campus Food Delivery Lean Canvas Challenge

## Overview

This challenge guides you through creating a Lean Canvas for a campus food delivery service. You'll identify business problems, define customer segments, complete all nine Lean Canvas blocks, build a customer persona, and outline a solution validation plan.

## Objective

- Complete all nine Lean Canvas sections for a campus food delivery service.
- Demonstrate understanding of business model components and customer-focused design.

## Instructions

### 1. Problem Identification

List the top 3 problems your service solves. For each problem, include:

- Evidence: What shows this is a real problem?
- Affected: Who experiences this?
- Frequency: How often does this occur?

**Example Problems:**
- Long queues at campus dining halls during peak hours
- Limited food options for students with dietary restrictions
- Inconvenience of going off-campus for diverse food choices

### 2. Customer Segments

Define your primary and secondary customer segments. For each segment, specify:

- Demographics: Age, year, major, living situation
- Behaviors: Eating habits, spending patterns, tech usage
- Pain Points: Specific frustrations related to food
- Size: Estimated number on campus

### 3. Complete Lean Canvas

Fill in all nine sections of the Lean Canvas:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEAN CANVAS                                        │

│ [Success indicators]       │ [Compelling message]   │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Unfair Advantage           │ Channels               │
│ [Hard to copy asset]       │ [Customer reach paths] │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Customer Segments          │ Cost Structure         │
│ [Target customers]         │ [Major costs]          │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Revenue Streams            │                        │
│ [How you make money]       │                        │
└────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

**Requirements for Each Section:**
- Problem: Alternatives, workarounds, pain points
- Solution: MVP features, rollout plan
- Key Metrics: Acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, referral
- Unique Value Proposition: Clear, compelling, differentiated
- Unfair Advantage: Not easily copied (e.g., partnerships, exclusive rights)
- Channels: Acquisition, activation, retention, campus-specific
- Customer Segments: Early adopters, mass market, user vs payer
- Cost Structure: Fixed/variable costs, biggest expenses
- Revenue Streams: Pricing model, segment revenue, lifetime value

### 4. Customer Persona

Create a detailed persona for your primary segment. Include:

- Name, age, year/major
- Background: Living situation, schedule, activities
- Tech proficiency, device usage
- Eating habits, food preferences
- Goals & motivations (academic, social, practical)
- Pain points (food-related frustrations)
- Typical day (morning, afternoon, evening, late night)
- Technology use (devices, apps, payment preferences)
- Quote expressing food-related frustration or desire

### 5. Solution Validation Plan

Outline a three-phase validation plan:

- Week 1-2: Problem Validation (method, target, questions, success metric)
- Week 3-4: Solution Validation (method, target, test, success metric)
- Week 5-6: MVP Test (method, scope, measurement, pivot criteria)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Canvas Completeness (40%): All 9 sections completed, detailed, campus-specific, logical connections
- Customer Focus (25%): Clear problems, segmentation, realistic persona, solution addresses pain points
- Business Logic (20%): Realistic revenue/costs, key metrics, feasible channels/unfair advantage, logical validation plan
- Presentation (15%): Clear canvas visualization, organized, professional formatting, no errors

## Required Deliverables

- Three identified problems with evidence
- Two customer segments with details
- Complete Lean Canvas with all 9 sections
- One detailed customer persona
- Three-phase validation plan

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Vague problems ("students are hungry")
- Assuming all students are the same
- Unrealistic unfair advantages
- Missing campus-specific considerations
- Revenue model not matching willingness to pay
- Overcomplicated solutions
- Not connecting solutions to specific problems
- Ignoring existing alternatives

## Example Lean Canvas Section

**Problem:**
1. 45-minute wait times at dining halls between 12-1 PM  
     - Evidence: Student surveys showing 78% complain about wait times  
     - Alternative: Skip meals or eat unhealthy snacks

2. Limited options for vegan/gluten-free students  
     - Evidence: Only 2 dining halls out of 7 offer special diet options  
     - Alternative: Cook in dorms or go off-campus

3. No late-night food options after 10 PM  
     - Evidence: 65% of students study past 10 PM, vending machines only option  
     - Alternative: Stockpile snacks or order expensive off-campus delivery

**Solution:**
1. Pre-order system for campus dining hall pickup  
     - Solves: Wait time problem  
     - MVP: Basic web app with 3 dining hall partners

2. Dedicated dietary filter and restaurant partnerships  
     - Solves: Limited options problem  
     - MVP: 2 specialized restaurant partners

3. Extended hours delivery from campus restaurants  
     - Solves: Late-night options problem  
     - MVP: 1 restaurant open until 2 AM

**Unique Value Proposition:**  
"Skip the line, eat on your time - Campus dining delivered to your dorm, library, or classroom in 20 minutes or less."

## Tips for Success

- Start with Problems: Validate problems exist before building solutions
- Be Specific: "Students in engineering building between classes" not "students"
- Think Campus-Scale: Consider campus geography, schedules, policies
- Research Existing: What food options already exist on/near campus?
- Consider Logistics: How will food actually get from kitchen to student?
- Test Assumptions: Which parts of your canvas are assumptions vs. facts?
- Keep it Simple: MVP should solve one problem well, not all problems poorly

## Bonus Challenges

- Competitor Analysis: Map 3 existing solutions and their weaknesses
- Financial Projection: 12-month revenue and cost projection
- Partnership Plan: Which campus entities would you partner with and why?
- Risk Assessment: Top 5 risks and mitigation strategies

- All 9 Lean Canvas sections completed
- Canvas shows logical flow between sections
- Detailed customer persona created
- 3-phase validation plan outlined
