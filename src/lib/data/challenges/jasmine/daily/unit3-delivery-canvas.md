# Campus Food Delivery Lean Canvas Challenge

## Overview

This challenge immerses you in the process of designing a Lean Canvas for a campus food delivery service. You'll identify real student pain points, define customer segments, map out a business model, and create a validation plan to test your assumptions—building entrepreneurial skills grounded in practical campus needs.

## Objective

Complete a campus-specific Lean Canvas, including customer research, persona development, and a stepwise validation plan, demonstrating your ability to connect business model logic with real-world student problems.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Lean Canvas and business model concepts
- Understanding of campus life and student routines
- Basic research and interviewing skills
- Ability to synthesize information into structured formats

## Instructions

### Part 1: Problem Identification

List the top 3 problems your campus food delivery service will solve. For each, provide:
- Evidence (survey, observation, data)
- Who is affected
- Frequency and context

### Part 2: Customer Segments

Define your primary and secondary customer segments:
- Demographics (age, year, major, living situation)
- Behaviors (eating habits, tech use, spending)
- Pain points and estimated segment size

### Part 3: Complete the Lean Canvas

Fill out all 9 Lean Canvas blocks:
- Problem
- Solution
- Key Metrics
- Unique Value Proposition
- Unfair Advantage
- Channels
- Customer Segments
- Cost Structure
- Revenue Streams

Use an ASCII/table format for clarity.

### Part 4: Customer Persona

Create a detailed persona for your primary segment, including:
- Name, age, year/major
- Background, tech use, eating habits
- Goals, motivations, pain points
- Typical day and a direct quote

### Part 5: Solution Validation Plan

Outline a three-phase plan:
- Week 1-2: Problem Validation (method, target, questions, success metric)
- Week 3-4: Solution Validation (method, target, test, success metric)
- Week 5-6: MVP Test (method, scope, measurement, pivot criteria)

## Deliverables

1. Three campus-specific problems with evidence
2. Two detailed customer segments
3. Completed Lean Canvas (all 9 sections)
4. One comprehensive customer persona
5. Three-phase solution validation plan

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Canvas Completeness     | 40%    | All 9 sections, campus-specific, logical connections             |
| Customer Focus          | 25%    | Clear problems, realistic segments/persona, solution fit         |
| Business Logic          | 20%    | Feasible revenue/costs, metrics, channels, validation plan       |
| Presentation            | 15%    | Clear canvas/table, organized, professional formatting, no errors|

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Validate problems before proposing solutions
- Be specific about customer segments and pain points
- Avoid generic or unrealistic unfair advantages
- Ensure revenue model matches student willingness to pay
- Connect each solution directly to a problem

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Map three competitors and their weaknesses
2. Draft a 12-month revenue/cost projection

## Submission

Submit your markdown document with all sections completed, using clear formatting and campus-specific details.
