# File Upload Button: Alternative UI Designs

## Overview

File upload buttons are a critical part of many web and app interfaces, yet their design can significantly impact usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. This challenge will help you practice ideation and evaluation by sketching and annotating two distinctly different file upload button designs, considering their visual style, placement, and user interaction.

## Objective

Sketch and annotate two alternative file upload button designs, highlighting their usability trade-offs. Compare the two and recommend one for a specific use case.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic file upload interactions in web or app interfaces
- Access to sketching tools (paper or digital)
- Basic understanding of usability and accessibility principles

## Instructions

### Part 1: Brainstorm and Sketch

1. Explore different paradigms for file upload (e.g., traditional button, drag-and-drop zone, icon-only, integrated with text field).
2. Select two clearly distinct concepts.
3. Sketch each design, including context (e.g., part of a form) and both pre- and post-upload states if possible.

### Part 2: Annotate

- For each sketch, add 2–4 bullet points each for pros and cons, focusing on usability, accessibility, and feedback.

### Part 3: Compare

- Write a 50–100 word paragraph comparing the two designs and recommend one for a specific scenario (e.g., job application portal), justifying your choice.

## Deliverables

1. Two sketch images (photo or digital export) of your designs
2. Annotations for each design (on image or as text)
3. Comparison paragraph (50–100 words)

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria            | Weight | Description                                                         |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Distinctness        | 25%    | Designs are meaningfully different, not minor variations            |
| Usability Analysis  | 30%    | Annotations reflect HCI principles and critical thinking            |
| Clarity of Sketch   | 20%    | Sketches and annotations are clear and understandable               |
| Justification       | 25%    | Comparison paragraph is thoughtful and scenario-appropriate         |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Think beyond default system buttons—consider user context and feedback
- Don’t neglect accessibility (labels, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Show what happens after file selection (e.g., file name, progress bar)
- Avoid overly complex or unfamiliar patterns unless justified
- Use standard icons for clarity

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Create an interactive prototype in a tool like Figma or Adobe XD
2. Conduct a quick accessibility audit of both designs

## Submission

Upload your sketches and text to your GitHub repository or LMS. If using paper, provide clear, well-lit photos. Name files as `Day6_Unit7_UploadDesign1.[jpg|png]`, `Day6_Unit7_UploadDesign2.[jpg|png]`, and include a `README.md` with your comparison.
