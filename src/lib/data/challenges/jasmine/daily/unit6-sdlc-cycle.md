# Mastering the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Overview

Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is essential for delivering successful software projects. This challenge guides you through all SDLC phases, helps you map deliverables, estimate timelines, and compare Waterfall and Agile methodologies, preparing you for real-world software engineering and project management.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will be able to identify, explain, and apply each SDLC phase, map key deliverables, estimate realistic durations, and critically compare Waterfall and Agile approaches for a 6-month software project.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with software project concepts
- Ability to interpret diagrams and tables
- Interest in software engineering methodologies
- Access to online documentation and resources

## Instructions

### Part 1: List and Explain SDLC Phases

- Identify all 7 SDLC phases.
- Write a concise (~50 words) explanation for each phase, including its purpose, main activities, and key participants.

### Part 2: Map Deliverables and Responsibilities

- Create a matrix mapping each phase to its technical, management, and quality deliverables.
- Clearly indicate which roles are responsible for each deliverable.

### Part 3: Visualize Dependencies and Feedback Loops

- Draw a diagram showing the sequence of SDLC phases.
- Annotate overlaps, feedback loops (e.g., Testing → Implementation), and continuous documentation.

### Part 4: Compare Waterfall and Agile

- Build a comparison table covering at least 8 aspects (e.g., phase sequence, requirements handling, testing timing, client involvement, documentation, change management, risk management, project suitability).

### Part 5: Estimate Phase Durations

- Allocate realistic durations (in days and %) to each phase for a 6-month (180-day) project.
- Break down each phase into major activities with estimated time.

## Deliverables

1. List and explanation of all 7 SDLC phases
2. Key deliverables matrix for 6 SDLC phases
3. Waterfall vs Agile comparison table
4. Phase dependency diagram with annotations
5. Phase duration estimates for a 6-month project

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                         |
|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Completeness            | 40%    | All phases, deliverables, tables, and diagrams included |
| Clarity & Accuracy      | 30%    | Explanations are concise, accurate, and well-structured |
| Depth of Comparison     | 20%    | Waterfall vs Agile table covers 8+ relevant aspects |
| Presentation & Formatting | 10%   | Well-organized, readable, and visually clear        |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Keep explanations concise but informative.
- Ensure all deliverables are mapped to the correct phase.
- Clearly show feedback loops and overlaps in your diagram.
- Double-check that phase durations add up to 180 days.
- Avoid generic or vague comparisons—be specific!

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Suggest how SDLC phases adapt in DevOps or Continuous Delivery environments.
2. Propose improvements for documentation practices across SDLC.

## Submission

Submit your completed markdown file with all sections filled out, including tables and diagrams, via your course platform or designated repository.
