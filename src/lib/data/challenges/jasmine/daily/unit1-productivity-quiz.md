# Software Developer Productivity Research Challenge

## Overview

Measuring software developer productivity is a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional metrics, the influence of team and project context, and the evolving nature of software work. This challenge guides you through designing a focused, researchable question and supporting materials for a practical productivity study.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will craft a clear research question, sub-questions, a concise problem statement, a research justification, and define measurable variables for a study on software developer productivity.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of software development practices
- Familiarity with research question structure
- Understanding of empirical research methods
- Experience with collaborative tools (e.g., Git, issue trackers)
- Academic writing skills

## Instructions

### Part 1: Problem Statement

Write a 100-word statement identifying key measurement problems, explaining why existing metrics fall short, stating the need for improved understanding, and specifying relevant contexts (e.g., distributed teams, junior developers).

### Part 2: Main Research Question

Formulate one clear, focused, and researchable question using a comparative, explanatory, or exploratory format relevant to software developer productivity.

### Part 3: Sub-Questions

Develop three concise sub-questions:
1. Break down the main question into a measurable component.
2. Address methodology or data collection.
3. Explore application, boundary conditions, or moderation.

### Part 4: Research Justification

Write a 150-word paragraph explaining the practical and theoretical importance, stakeholder benefits, and how your study fills a research gap.

### Part 5: Measurable Variables

List three variables with measurement details:
- Independent Variable: Name, measurement method, and scale.
- Dependent Variable: Name, measurement method, and scale.
- Control Variable: Name, control method, and reason for control.

## Deliverables

1. Main research question
2. Three supporting sub-questions
3. 100-word problem statement
4. 150-word research justification
5. List of three measurable variables with details

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                      | Weight | Description                                         |
|-------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Clarity and focus of questions| 30%    | Research question and sub-questions are precise     |
| Problem statement & justification | 30% | Meets word count, relevance, and depth              |
| Variable definition & measurability | 25% | Variables are well-defined and measurable           |
| Formatting & language         | 15%    | Submission is well-structured and error-free        |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Be specific about context and variables
- Avoid vague or overly broad questions
- Ensure variables are measurable with available tools
- Double-check word counts for statements

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Propose an alternative productivity metric and justify its use
2. Suggest a data collection plan for a remote development team

## Submission

Submit your completed markdown document following the structure above via your course platform or designated submission system.
