# Software Developer Productivity Research Question

## Overview
Measuring software developer productivity is difficult: common metrics can miss meaningful signals, context matters, and measurement choices influence conclusions. This activity guides you to craft a focused, measurable research question and supporting materials for a realistic study.

## Objective
Produce a single, clear research question and supporting elements (problem statement, sub-questions, justification, and measurable variables) that together form a feasible study plan.

## Instructions

### Part 1 — Problem Statement (exactly 100 words)
Write a concise problem statement that:
- Identifies 2–3 specific measurement problems
- Explains why existing metrics are insufficient
- States the need for improved understanding
- Mentions specific contexts where this matters (e.g., distributed teams, junior developers, enterprise systems)

Use this template to guide structure:
Current software development productivity measurement faces [problem 1], [problem 2], and [problem 3]. This is problematic because [consequence 1] and [consequence 2]. There is a need to [what needs to be understood better], particularly in [specific context]. Understanding [key aspect] could lead to [potential benefit].

### Part 2 — Main Research Question
Craft one main research question that is:
- Clear, focused, researchable, relevant, and feasible.
Choose a format: comparative, explanatory, or exploratory. Avoid being too broad or vague.

Examples of good formats:
- Comparative: How does [A] compare with [B] in terms of [outcome] for [population]?
- Explanatory: What factors influence [phenomenon] in [context]?
- Exploratory: What are the characteristics of [phenomenon] in [context]?

### Part 3 — Three Sub-Questions
Provide three concise sub-questions that support the main question:
1. One that breaks down the main question into a measurable component.
2. One that addresses methodology or data collection.
3. One that addresses application, boundary conditions, or moderation.

### Part 4 — Research Justification (150 words)
Write a single 150-word paragraph that explains:
- Practical importance to industry
- Theoretical contribution to software engineering knowledge
- Benefits to stakeholders (developers, managers, organizations)
- How it fills a gap in existing research
Be specific about impact and feasibility.

### Part 5 — Measurable Variables
List three variables with clear measurement plans:

### Independent Variable
- Variable: [Name]
- Measurement: [How to manipulate or observe it]
- Scale: [Nominal / Ordinal / Interval / Ratio]

### Dependent Variable
- Variable: [Name]
- Measurement: [How to measure outcome]
- Scale: [Nominal / Ordinal / Interval / Ratio]

### Control Variable
- Variable: [Name]
- Control Method: [How to hold constant or account for it]
- Reason: [Why controlling it matters]

## Formatting Your Response
Provide your submission using this structure:

```markdown
# Software Developer Productivity Research

## Part 1: Problem Statement
[100-word statement]

## Part 2: Main Research Question
[One clear, focused question]

## Part 3: Sub-Questions
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Part 4: Research Justification
[150-word paragraph]

## Part 5: Measurable Variables
### Independent Variable
- Variable:
- Measurement:
- Scale:

### Dependent Variable
- Variable:
- Measurement:
- Scale:

### Control Variable
- Variable:
- Control Method:
- Reason:
```

## Evaluation Checklist
- Problem statement = 100 words
- Justification = 150 words
- Main question is clear and researchable
- Sub-questions logically support the main question
- Variables are measurable and correctly classified
- Submission is well-formatted and free of grammatical errors

## Tips
- Be as specific as possible about context (language, team type, project size).
- Prefer variables you can actually measure with accessible tools (e.g., commit data, issue trackers, surveys).
- Keep scope feasible for a short empirical study.

Good luck — focus on clarity, feasibility, and measurable outcomes.
