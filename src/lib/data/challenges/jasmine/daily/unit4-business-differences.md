Example Difference Analysis
text
## Difference 1: Geographic Market Reach and Boundaries

### Traditional Business Approach
- Characteristic: Physical location determines customer base; limited by geography
- Example: A local bookstore serving customers within 10-mile radius
- Limitations: Can't serve customers outside physical reach; expansion requires new locations
- Typical Process: Customers must travel to physical store; delivery limited to local area

### E-Business Approach
- Characteristic: Virtual presence enables global reach; serves customers worldwide
- Example: Amazon serving customers across continents from centralized warehouses
- Advantages: Access to global markets without physical presence in each location
- Typical Process: Online ordering with global shipping logistics; digital product delivery

### Analysis of Impact
- Operational Impact: Requires international shipping, currency handling, multilingual support
- Cost Structure: Lower physical infrastructure costs but higher logistics complexity
- Customer Experience: 24/7 access from anywhere but lacks personal touch of local store
- Competitive Advantage: Scale advantages but faces global competition
- Required Capabilities: International logistics, digital marketing, cross-border legal knowledge
Tips for Success
Think Strategically: How do differences create competitive advantage?

Use Specific Examples: Name real companies for both traditional and e-business

Consider Both Sides: What advantages do traditional businesses still have?

Look Beyond Technology: How do business processes, culture, and strategy differ?

Consider Evolution: How are traditional businesses adapting digital elements?

Analyze Trade-offs: Every advantage of e-business has corresponding challenges

Connect to Fundamentals: How do differences affect basic business elements (profit, growth, risk)?

Think About People: How do differences affect employees, managers, customers?

Bonus Challenges
Industry-Specific Analysis: Compare differences in retail vs manufacturing vs services

Hybrid Model Design: Create a business model combining best of both approaches

Digital Transformation Roadmap: Outline steps for traditional business to adopt e-business elements

Risk Comparison: Analyze different risk profiles and mitigation strategies

Sustainability Impact: Compare environmental and social impacts of both models
