# Production-Ready Research Portfolio

## Overview

Create a comprehensive research portfolio that demonstrates your academic research, design, and web development skills. This challenge simulates real-world scenarios where you must communicate your work through a professional website and presentation.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will research a computing topic, write a formal proposal, design and prototype a portfolio website, implement and deploy it, and present your work professionally.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of academic research methods
- Familiarity with Figma or Adobe XD
- Experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Git and GitHub basics
- Access to a modern code editor (e.g., VS Code)

## Instructions

### Part 1: Academic Research & Proposal

1. Select a computing research topic.
2. Conduct a literature review (10+ academic sources).
3. Write a 5+ page research proposal in APA format, including:
     - Title page, abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, expected contributions, references.

### Part 2: UI/UX Design Prototypes

1. Sketch wireframes for all website pages.
2. Create high-fidelity prototypes in Figma or Adobe XD (desktop & mobile).
3. Document your design system (typography, color palette, components).
4. Ensure accessibility and responsive design.

### Part 3: Portfolio Website Development & Deployment

1. Build the portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React).
2. Implement all required pages: Home, Research, Projects, About, Contact.
3. Optimize for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
4. Deploy the site using Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
5. Prepare a comprehensive README and deployment info.

## Deliverables

1. Research proposal document (PDF, APA format)
2. UI/UX design prototypes (Figma/XD link, PDF/PNG exports, design system)
3. Deployed portfolio website (live URL, GitHub repo)
4. Presentation slides (PDF or PowerPoint)
5. README documentation

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Research Proposal       | 25%    | Quality, rigor, formatting, and academic writing |
| UI/UX Design            | 25%    | Visual hierarchy, accessibility, documentation   |
| Website Implementation  | 30%    | Code quality, responsiveness, deployment         |
| Presentation            | 10%    | Content, professionalism, clarity                |
| Documentation           | 10%    | README, code comments, repo organization         |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Start early and manage your time.
- Always cite sources properly to avoid plagiarism.
- Test your website on multiple devices.
- Use a consistent design system.
- Proofread all documents and presentations.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Add a blog section or dark mode toggle.
2. Integrate a contact form with backend (e.g., Netlify Forms).
