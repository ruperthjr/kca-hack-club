# RISC vs CISC Architecture: Comparison Challenge

## Overview

This challenge guides you through a structured comparison of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures. You'll explore their principles, historical evolution, performance trade-offs, and modern convergence, gaining insight into how these architectures shape today's processors.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will produce a comprehensive report comparing RISC and CISC architectures, analyze their performance characteristics, and summarize real-world case studies.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of computer architecture concepts
- Access to research materials (see Resources)
- Familiarity with CPU instruction sets

## Instructions

### Part 1: Research Fundamental Concepts

- Define RISC and CISC architectures, listing their core principles.
- Summarize the historical context and evolution of both architectures.
- Identify key differences in instruction set design, memory models, and control logic.

### Part 2: Comparative Analysis

- Create a comparison matrix highlighting differences in instruction size, complexity, memory access, decode/control, cycles per instruction, code density, and compiler roles.
- Provide code examples illustrating typical RISC and CISC instructions.
- Analyze performance trade-offs using the performance equation:  
  `Time = (Instructions/Program) × (Cycles/Instruction) × (Time/Cycle)`
- Include a quantitative example comparing RISC and CISC execution.

### Part 3: Case Studies & Future Trends

- Summarize two real-world processors: one RISC-based (e.g., Apple M2/ARM) and one CISC-based (e.g., Intel Core i9/x86).
- Discuss how modern processors blend RISC and CISC features.
- Predict future trends in processor architecture and provide recommendations for architects and developers.

## Deliverables

1. Well-structured comparison report (Markdown or PDF)
2. Completed comparison matrix and performance analysis
3. Case study summaries and future trend predictions

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                         |
|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Research Depth          | 30%    | Coverage, correctness, and modern context           |
| Analytical Rigor        | 30%    | Clear comparison and quantitative analysis          |
| Critical Insight        | 25%    | Convergence, predictions, and recommendations       |
| Presentation            | 15%    | Structure, clarity, and technical correctness       |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use concrete examples to support your analysis.
- Avoid superficial comparisons—focus on technical reasoning.
- Don't overlook the impact of modern convergence (e.g., x86 μops).
- Ensure your report is well-organized and clearly formatted.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Analyze a domain-specific accelerator (e.g., TPU, NPU) and its ISA.
2. Compare RISC-V and ARM in terms of ecosystem and adoption.
