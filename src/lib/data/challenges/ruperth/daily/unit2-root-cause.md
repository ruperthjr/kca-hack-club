# Five Whys Root Cause Analysis for Time-Bound Software Bugs

## Overview

This challenge guides you through using the Five Whys technique to uncover the root cause of a recurring, time-bound crash in a mobile banking app. You'll analyze the bug, validate your findings, and propose actionable steps to prevent similar issues, strengthening your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will systematically identify the root cause of a software bug using the Five Whys, validate your analysis, and design effective preventative actions, all while applying systems thinking to ensure long-term improvement.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic software debugging
- Understanding of requirements gathering and testing processes
- Access to the provided bug scenario and worksheet template

## Instructions

### Part 1: Five Whys Analysis

- Review the provided bug scenario: A mobile banking app crashes during money transfers between 11:55 PM and 12:05 AM due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
- Complete a Five Whys analysis chart, drilling down from the symptom to the root cause.
- Support each "why" with concrete evidence (logs, code, documentation).

### Part 2: Root Cause Validation

- Use the True Root Cause Checklist to validate your root cause statement:
  - Will addressing it prevent recurrence?
  - Is it within the team's control?
  - Is it specific and actionable?
  - Does it explain the bug's recurrence?
- Consider and briefly reject alternative hypotheses.

### Part 3: Preventative Actions & Systems Thinking

- Propose three specific preventative actions, each with an owner, timeline, and success metric.
- Write a brief systems thinking analysis connecting requirements, development, testing, deployment, and feedback loops.
- Identify leverage points and interconnections that can prevent similar bugs.

## Deliverables

1. Completed Five Whys analysis chart
2. Validated root cause statement
3. Three preventative actions (with owner, timeline, metric)
4. Systems thinking analysis write-up

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Logical Five Whys       | 40%    | Depth, clarity, and evidence at each level       |
| Action Effectiveness    | 30%    | Specificity and impact of preventative measures   |
| Validation & Systems    | 20%    | Rigor in validation and systemic connections     |
| Presentation & Clarity  | 10%    | Organization, grammar, and completeness          |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Ask genuine "why" questions to dig deeper.
- Always support answers with evidence.
- Focus on process and design, not blaming individuals.
- Ensure actions are measurable and realistic.
- Avoid stopping at symptoms or surface-level fixes.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Apply the Five Whys template to a real incident from your team's backlog.
2. Create a facilitation guide for running Five Whys sessions.

## Submission

Submit your completed analysis and write-up as a Markdown or PDF file according to the provided structure.
