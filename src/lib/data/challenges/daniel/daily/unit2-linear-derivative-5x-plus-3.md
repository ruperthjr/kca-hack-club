# Derivative of a Linear Function

## Overview

This challenge introduces the concept of derivatives through the lens of a linear function. You'll learn how to apply the power rule, interpret the derivative as the slope of a line, and connect algebraic manipulation to calculus concepts. This foundational skill is essential for understanding rates of change in mathematics and science.

## Objective

By completing this challenge, you will confidently compute the derivative of `f(x) = 5x + 3`, explain its meaning, and present your reasoning in a clear, step-by-step format.

## Prerequisites

- Basic algebraic manipulation (working with variables and constants)
- Understanding of function notation and graphing
- Familiarity with exponents and linear equations
- Interest in learning core calculus concepts

## Instructions

### Part 1: Understand the Power Rule

- Review the power rule: If `f(x) = x^n`, then `f'(x) = n·x^(n-1)`.
- For a constant term, the derivative is always zero.
- In your own words, write a brief summary of the power rule and its application to linear and constant terms.

### Part 2: Differentiate f(x) = 5x + 3

1. Separate the function into its terms: `5x` and `3`.
2. Differentiate `5x` using the power rule:
     - Rewrite as `5·x^1`.
     - Derivative: `5 * 1 * x^(1-1) = 5 * x^0 = 5`.
3. Differentiate the constant `3`: derivative is `0`.
4. Combine results: `f'(x) = 5 + 0 = 5`.
5. Show each step clearly and explain your reasoning.

### Part 3: Interpret and Illustrate

- Explain what `f'(x) = 5` means in the context of the original function.
- Sketch or use a graphing tool to illustrate `f(x) = 5x + 3` and label its slope.
- Write a single sentence summarizing the meaning of the derivative for this function.

## Deliverables

1. Step-by-step written differentiation of `f(x) = 5x + 3`.
2. A one-sentence explanation of the derivative's meaning.
3. A labeled sketch or digital graph of the function and its slope.
4. Clear, organized presentation of all steps.
5. Brief reflection on how algebra and calculus connect in this example.

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Always apply the power rule to each term separately.
