# Weekly Goals Text File

## Overview

Organizing files and setting clear goals are foundational computer skills. This challenge simulates a real-world task: creating a dedicated folder for a project and using a simple text file to document your objectives for the week. It's a core practice for students, developers, and professionals alike.

## Objective

Create a folder named `Projects` and, inside it, create a plain text file called `goals.txt`. In that file, list at least three specific, actionable goals you want to accomplish this week.

## Prerequisites

- Ability to open a text editor and save files.
- Basic file system navigation skills (finding Desktop, Documents, etc.).

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create the "Projects" Folder

1.  Navigate to a convenient location on your computer, such as your Desktop or Documents folder.
2.  Create a new folder and name it `Projects`.
        -   On Windows: Right-click → New → Folder.
        -   On macOS: Right-click (or Ctrl-click) → New Folder.
3.  If a `Projects` folder already exists in that location, you may use it.

### Part 2: Create and Edit `goals.txt`

1.  Open your preferred text editor (e.g., Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS).
2.  Create a new document. Write a title like “My Goals for the Week” and then list at least three goals.
3.  Make your goals specific and measurable (e.g., “Complete the HTML image challenge,” “Read one chapter of a book,” “Exercise three times”).
4.  Save the file with the exact name `goals.txt` inside the `Projects` folder you created or identified.

### Part 3: Verify and Submit

1.  Navigate to your `Projects` folder and open `goals.txt` to confirm the content is saved correctly.
2.  Take a screenshot that shows both the folder structure (the file path) and the content of the file.
3.  Submit the screenshot as your deliverable.

## Deliverables

1.  A single screenshot that clearly shows the `Projects` folder, the `goals.txt` file inside it, and the text content of the file.
2.  The file path (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Projects\goals.txt`) must be visible in the screenshot.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                 | Weight | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Folder Creation          | 20%    | A folder named `Projects` exists at a logical location.      |
| File Name and Location   | 30%    | A file is correctly named `goals.txt` and placed inside the `Projects` folder. |
| Goal Content             | 30%    | The file contains at least three distinct, meaningful goals. |
| Submission Clarity       | 20%    | The submitted screenshot clearly shows both the file path and its text content. |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

-   Be careful with file extensions: ensure the file is `goals.txt`, not `goals.txt.txt` or `goals.rtf`.
-   If you use a word processor like Microsoft Word, make sure to save or export the file as "Plain Text (.txt)".
-   Store the `Projects` folder somewhere you can easily find it again, like your Desktop or Documents folder.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1.  Add a date line at the top of the file (e.g., “Week of 2026-02-13”).
2.  Create a subfolder inside `Projects` named `Week1` and save the `goals.txt` file there instead.
3.  Write your goals using markdown-style bullet points (using asterisks or dashes).

## Submission

Upload your screenshot to the submission form. Ensure the screenshot is clear and readable.
