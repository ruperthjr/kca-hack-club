# Binary Number System Conversion Challenge

## Overview

This challenge introduces you to the binary number system, a foundational concept in computer science and digital electronics. You'll learn to convert decimal numbers to binary, understand binary place values, and apply binary arithmetic—skills crucial for programming, hardware design, and understanding how computers process data.

## Objective

Convert decimal numbers to binary using the division-by-2 method, verify your results, and deepen your understanding of binary representation and arithmetic.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with decimal numbers and basic arithmetic.
- Pen and paper for manual calculations.
- Calculator or online binary converter (optional).

## Instructions

### Part 1: Understand Binary Basics

- Review the binary (base-2) number system: digits 0 and 1.
- Learn about bits (single binary digit), nibbles (4 bits), and bytes (8 bits).
- Understand binary place values: 2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³, etc.

### Part 2: Convert Decimal 10 to Binary

1. Use the division-by-2 method:
  - Divide 10 by 2, record the quotient and remainder.
  - Repeat with the quotient until it reaches 0.
  - Write the remainders in reverse order to get the binary result.
2. Show your work in a step-by-step table.

### Part 3: Practice Additional Conversions

- Convert decimal 7, 15, and 21 to binary using the same method.
- Show all steps and final binary representations.

### Part 4: Explore Binary Concepts

- Explain the maximum decimal number representable with 4, 8, and 16 bits.
- Write the binary representations for decimal 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Calculate binary 1010 + 0001 and show your work.

## Deliverables

1. Step-by-step conversion of decimal 10 to binary.
2. Verification of your conversion using arithmetic expansion.
3. Three additional conversions (7, 15, 21) with all steps shown.
4. Answers to binary concept questions.
5. Submission as a PDF or Markdown file with clear sections.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy                | 40%    | Correctness of all binary conversions.           |
| Methodology             | 30%    | Clear use of division-by-2 method and explanations.|
| Verification            | 20%    | Proper validation of conversion results.         |
| Extension & Concepts    | 10%    | Accurate answers to binary concept questions.    |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Always read remainders from bottom to top.
- Continue dividing until the quotient is 0.
- Double-check binary place values (powers of 2).
- Don’t confuse binary with hexadecimal or octal.
- Verify your results by converting back to decimal.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Convert a larger decimal (e.g., 123) to binary and explain each step.
2. Explore how negative numbers are represented in binary (two’s complement).

## Submission

Submit your completed work as a PDF or Markdown file. Include all calculations, explanations, and answers to concept questions. Ensure your submission is well-organized and clearly labeled.
