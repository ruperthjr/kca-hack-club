# Set of Days of the Week

## Overview

Sets are a foundational concept in discrete mathematics, providing a way to group and analyze collections of distinct objects. This challenge uses the familiar context of the days of the week to help you practice writing sets in roster notation and understanding set properties.

## Objective

Represent the set of all days of the week using correct roster notation and determine its cardinality.

## Prerequisites

- Ability to list all days of the week
- Basic familiarity with mathematical notation

## Instructions

### Part 1: Understanding Roster Notation

A set in roster notation is written by listing its distinct elements inside curly braces, separated by commas.  
Example: The set of primary colors is `{red, green, blue}`.  
Order does not matter, and elements are not repeated.

### Part 2: Writing the Set

1. List the seven days of the week.
2. Place them inside curly braces, separated by commas.  
     Example: `{Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday}`  
     (Use full names or consistent abbreviations.)

### Part 3: Determining Cardinality

Count the number of elements in your set.  
Express the cardinality using the notation `|D| = 7`, where `D` is your set.

## Deliverables

1. The set `D` of all days of the week in roster notation.
2. The cardinality of `D` as `|D| = 7`.
3. A brief explanation of how a set differs from a list.
4. (Optional) Sets for weekdays, weekends, and months with 31 days.
5. Submit your work as plain text, PDF, or an image.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Correct roster notation    | 30%    | Proper use of curly braces and commas            |
| All days included          | 40%    | No missing or duplicate days                     |
| No extra elements          | 10%    | Only days of the week listed                     |
| Cardinality stated         | 20%    | Correct use of `|D| = 7` notation                |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Do not use quotation marks around day names unless explicitly required.
- Sets are unordered; the order of days does not matter.
- Avoid including extra punctuation or the word "and" inside the braces.
- Double-check that all seven days are present and unique.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Write the set of weekdays (Monday to Friday) and state its cardinality.
2. Write the set of weekend days and state its cardinality.
3. List the set of months with 31 days.

## Submission

Submit your answer as plain text, PDF, or an image of your handwritten work.
