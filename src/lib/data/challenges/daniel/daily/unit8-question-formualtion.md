# System Analysis Question Formulation Challenge

## Overview

This challenge develops your ability to ask targeted, analytical questions that reveal the structure, requirements, and stakeholder needs of complex systems. You'll focus on a university registration system, learning to uncover both explicit and hidden requirements through effective inquiry.

## Objective

Formulate three comprehensive questions about a university registration system, each designed to extract critical information about workflows, exception handling, and stakeholder experiences. For each, provide the purpose, relevant stakeholders, and follow-up questions.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic university processes.
- Access to the "Technical Communication, 14th Edition" textbook.
- Note-taking tool (digital or paper).
- Familiarity with stakeholder roles and process flows.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Analyze the System Context

- Review the components of a university registration system: student management, course catalog, prerequisites, capacity, payments, advising, and reporting.
- Identify key stakeholders: students, faculty, advisors, registrar staff, IT admins, bursar, department chairs.

### Part 2: Develop Question Categories

- Process Flow: How does information move through the system? What are the steps and decision points?
- Exception Handling: How are errors or conflicts managed? What backup processes exist?
- Stakeholder Experience: How do different users interact with the system? What are their pain points?

### Part 3: Formulate and Refine Questions

For each question, include:
- The question (clear and specific)
- Purpose/objective
- Primary stakeholders
- 2-3 potential follow-up questions
- Brief rationale for your approach

Apply these techniques:
- Use precise, open-ended questions.
- Frame from user and admin perspectives.
- Address both typical and edge-case scenarios.

## Deliverables

1. Three comprehensive, well-structured questions about the university registration system.
2. Purpose and objective for each question.
3. List of primary stakeholders for each question.
4. 2-3 potential follow-up questions per main question.
5. Brief rationale for question design choices.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                  | Weight | Description                                         |
|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Depth of Inquiry          | 40%    | Reveals meaningful insights into system workflows.  |
| Clarity & Specificity     | 30%    | Questions are clear, precise, and unambiguous.      |
| Stakeholder Consideration | 20%    | Appropriately targets relevant stakeholders.        |
| Analytical Thinking       | 10%    | Demonstrates systems thinking and critical analysis.|

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Avoid yes/no or overly broad questions.
- Consider both technical and human factors.
- Don’t overlook exception scenarios or minor stakeholders.
- Use open-ended, stakeholder-centered phrasing.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Create a stakeholder map for the registration system.
2. Draft a mini-interview script for requirements gathering.

## Submission

Submit a PDF or Markdown file containing your three questions, purposes, stakeholders, follow-ups, and rationales.
