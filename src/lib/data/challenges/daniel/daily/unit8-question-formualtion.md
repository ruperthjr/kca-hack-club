# System Analysis Question Formulation Challenge

## Overview

In this analytical thinking challenge, you'll develop the crucial skill of asking the right questions to understand complex systems. You'll create three comprehensive questions to analyze a university registration system, focusing on uncovering both obvious and hidden requirements.

## Objective

Formulate three insightful questions that would help you understand how a university registration system works, including explanations of what each question aims to discover and which stakeholders could provide answers.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the System Context

Consider what a university registration system involves:

**Key Components:**
- Student information management
- Course catalog and scheduling
- Prerequisite checking
- Capacity management
- Payment processing
- Academic advising integration
- Reporting and analytics

**Potential Stakeholders:**
- Students (primary users)
- Faculty (course creators)
- Academic advisors
- Registrar's office staff
- IT administrators
- Bursar's office (financial)
- Department chairs

### Step 2: Develop Question Categories

Create questions that cover different aspects:

1. **Process Flow Question:**
     - How does data move through the system?
     - What are the sequential steps?
     - Where are decision points?

2. **Exception Handling Question:**
     - What happens when things go wrong?
     - How are conflicts resolved?
     - What backup processes exist?

3. **Stakeholder Experience Question:**
     - How do different users interact with the system?
     - What pain points exist?
     - How could the experience be improved?

### Step 3: Formulate Your Three Questions

For each question, provide:

**Question Structure:**
- Clear, specific question
- Purpose (what you hope to learn)
- Target stakeholder(s) who could answer
- Follow-up questions that might arise

**Example Framework:**
```
Question 1: [Your first comprehensive question]

Purpose: This question aims to discover [specific information about the system]

Primary Stakeholders: [List 2-3 roles who could answer]

Potential Follow-ups:
- How does this process handle exceptions?
- What metrics track the success of this workflow?
```

### Step 4: Refine Your Questions

Apply these refinement techniques:

- **Specificity Check:** Replace vague terms with precise ones  
    Instead of: "How does registration work?"  
    Use: "What is the step-by-step process a student follows from course selection to confirmed enrollment?"

- **Open-ended vs Closed:** Ensure questions prompt detailed answers  
    Good: "What are the most common points of failure in the registration workflow?"  
    Poor: "Does the system ever fail?" (yes/no answer)

- **Stakeholder-centered:** Frame questions from user perspectives  
    Student perspective: "What information do students need before they can register?"  
    Admin perspective: "How do administrators override system decisions when necessary?"

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Depth of Inquiry (40%)**: Questions reveal meaningful system insights
- **Clarity & Specificity (30%)**: Clear, unambiguous question formulation
- **Stakeholder Consideration (20%)**: Appropriate targeting of question recipients
- **Analytical Thinking (10%)**: Demonstration of systems thinking approach

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Asking yes/no questions that don't elicit detailed information
- Focusing only on technology without considering people/processes
- Formulating leading questions that suggest desired answers
- Overlooking important stakeholder groups
- Creating overly broad questions that can't be answered concisely
- Not considering edge cases or exception scenarios

## Real-World Application

Effective question formulation helps you:

- Gather accurate requirements for software projects
- Conduct user interviews and stakeholder meetings
- Troubleshoot complex system issues
- Design better user experiences
- Communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences
- Prepare for business analysis or product management roles

## Submission Format

Submit a single document containing:

- Three comprehensive questions about university registration system

For each question include:
1. The formulated question
2. Purpose/objective of the question
3. Primary stakeholders who could answer
4. 2-3 potential follow-up questions

**Format:** PDF or Markdown file
