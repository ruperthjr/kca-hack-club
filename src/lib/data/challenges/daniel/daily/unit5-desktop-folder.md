# File System Organization Challenge

## Overview

In this practical challenge, you'll establish a fundamental skill for all computer users: organizing files and folders effectively. You'll create a structured project folder on your desktop that can scale as you take on more complex programming assignments.

## Objective

Create a "Projects" folder on your desktop with proper naming conventions and a logical subfolder structure for organizing different types of coding projects.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Main Projects Folder

Navigate to your desktop and create a new folder:

- **Windows:**
    - Right-click on empty desktop area
    - Select "New" → "Folder"
    - Name the folder exactly: Projects

- **macOS:**
    - Right-click on desktop (or Ctrl-click)
    - Select "New Folder"
    - Name the folder exactly: Projects

- **Linux:**
    - Open terminal
    - Type: `mkdir ~/Desktop/Projects`
    - Or use your desktop environment's file manager

### Step 2: Create Subfolder Structure

Inside your Projects folder, create these subfolders:

- **Academic Projects:**
    - `School/` (for coursework)
    - `Assignments/` (for individual assignments)
    - `Exams/` (for exam preparation materials)
- **Personal Projects:**
    - `Websites/` (for HTML/CSS/JS projects)
    - `Scripts/` (for automation and utility scripts)
    - `Learning/` (for tutorials and skill development)
- **Future Planning:**
    - `Ideas/` (for project concepts and notes)
    - `Resources/` (for reference materials)
    - `Archive/` (for completed projects)

### Step 3: Apply Naming Conventions

Follow these rules for all folders:

- Use lowercase letters (except where capitalization adds clarity)
- Use hyphens for spaces (e.g., `web-projects` not `web projects`)
- Keep names short but descriptive (max 20 characters)
- Avoid special characters (no: \ / : * ? " &lt; &gt; |)
- Use consistent date format in project folders: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-name`

### Step 4: Test Your Structure

- Navigate into your `Projects/Websites/` folder
- Create a test folder: `2026-02-10-first-website`
- Create another in `Projects/School/`: `2026-02-10-algorithms-assignment`
- Verify you can easily find and navigate between these

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Structure (40%)**: Correct folder creation and hierarchy
- **Naming (30%)**: Proper use of conventions and clarity
- **Organization (20%)**: Logical grouping of project types
- **Completeness (10%)**: All required folders created

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Creating folders with spaces (use hyphens instead)
- Putting too many items directly in root Projects folder
- Using inconsistent naming (mix of camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Forgetting to create the Archive folder for future use
- Not testing navigation through the folder structure

## Real-World Application

Effective file organization helps you:

- Find projects quickly without searching
- Maintain clean backups and version control
- Collaborate with others on shared projects
- Transition projects from development to completion
- Prepare for professional software development workflows

## Submission Format

Submit a single screenshot showing:

- Folder structure visible in file explorer
- Clear view of desktop with Projects folder
- At least three subfolders created inside Projects

Include a text file with:

- Your folder organization strategy (3-4 sentences)
- Three project ideas that would use this structure
