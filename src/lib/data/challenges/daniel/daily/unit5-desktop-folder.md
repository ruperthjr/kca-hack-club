# File System Organization Challenge

## Overview

This challenge will help you master digital organization by designing a scalable folder structure on your desktop. You'll learn to apply best practices for naming and organizing files, making it easier to manage projects, collaborate, and maintain backups.

## Objective

Create a well-structured "Projects" folder on your desktop, complete with logical subfolders and consistent naming conventions, to streamline your workflow and improve digital organization.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of using a file explorer or terminal.
- Access to a computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Ability to take screenshots and create text files.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create the Main Projects Folder

- On your desktop, create a folder named `Projects` using your operating system's file manager or terminal.

### Part 2: Build the Subfolder Hierarchy

Inside `Projects`, create these subfolders:

- `academic-projects/`
  - `school/`
  - `assignments/`
  - `exams/`
- `personal-projects/`
  - `websites/`
  - `scripts/`
  - `learning/`
- `future-planning/`
  - `ideas/`
  - `resources/`
  - `archive/`

### Part 3: Apply Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase letters (capitalize only for clarity).
- Replace spaces with hyphens (e.g., `web-projects`).
- Limit folder names to 20 characters.
- Avoid special characters (`\`, `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`).
- For project folders, use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-name`.

## Deliverables

1. Screenshot showing the complete Projects folder structure.
2. Text file (strategy.txt) describing your organization strategy.
3. List of three project ideas suited to your structure.
4. Example folders demonstrating correct naming conventions.
5. README summarizing your approach and lessons learned.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria         | Weight | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Structure        | 40%    | Correct folder hierarchy and organization.       |
| Naming           | 30%    | Consistent and clear naming conventions.         |
| Organization     | 20%    | Logical grouping of project types.               |
| Completeness     | 10%    | All required folders and documentation provided. |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use hyphens instead of spaces in folder names.
- Avoid placing files directly in the root Projects folder.
- Stick to one naming convention throughout.
- Don't forget to create the `archive` folder.
- Test navigation to ensure everything is easy to find.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Automate folder creation with a script for your OS.
2. Add a README.md in each main subfolder describing its purpose.

## Submission

Submit your screenshot, strategy.txt, project ideas list, and README file as a compressed folder.
