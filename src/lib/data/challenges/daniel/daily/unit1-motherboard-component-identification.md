# Motherboard Component Identification

## Overview

This challenge introduces you to the essential components of a computer motherboard. By identifying, labeling, and describing the CPU socket, RAM slots, and storage connectors, you'll gain practical skills crucial for hardware troubleshooting, upgrades, and system assembly.

## Objective

Accurately identify and label the CPU socket, RAM slots, and storage connectors (SATA/M.2) on a motherboard diagram or photo, and provide concise descriptions of each component's function.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of computer hardware.
- Access to a motherboard image (photo or online).
- Image editing software.
- Reference materials (textbook or online guides).

## Instructions

### Part 1: Obtain a Motherboard Image

- Find a high-resolution image of a modern ATX motherboard (2018 or newer) or take a clear photo of a physical motherboard.
- Ensure the image shows the CPU socket, RAM slots, and storage connectors.

### Part 2: Identify and Label Components

- Using your references, locate and label:
  - CPU Socket
  - RAM Slots
  - SATA Ports
  - M.2 Slot(s)
- Use arrows or boxes and color-code each component type.
- Add a title to your diagram: "Motherboard Component Map - [Your Name]".

### Part 3: Write Component Descriptions

- For each component (CPU, RAM, Storage Connectors), write 2-3 sentences explaining:
  - Its function in the system.
  - Key characteristics or identifiers.
  - Importance for system operation.

## Deliverables

1. Labeled motherboard diagram (PNG, JPG, or PDF).
2. Written descriptions for CPU, RAM, and storage connectors.
3. Documentation file including motherboard model and form factor.
4. Screenshot or exported image of your labeled diagram.
5. Organized submission with clear file names.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria         | Weight | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy         | 40%    | Correct identification and labeling of components|
| Clarity          | 30%    | Clear, readable labels and organized diagram     |
| Explanations     | 20%    | Quality and completeness of component descriptions|
| Presentation     | 10%    | Professional appearance and documentation        |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Double-check component locations using manufacturer diagrams.
- Don’t confuse RAM slots with PCIe slots—RAM slots have clips on both ends.
- Ensure your image is clear and labels are legible.
- Specify which SATA or M.2 ports you are labeling if there are multiples.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Identify and label the chipset, PCIe x16 slot, and 24-pin power connector.
2. Research and note the specific CPU socket type (e.g., LGA1700, AM5).
3. Find and describe the CMOS battery’s function.
4. Compare desktop and laptop motherboard layouts.

## Submission

Submit your labeled diagram and documentation file (TXT, MD, or PDF). Include your name and the date in your files.
