# Motherboard Component Identification Challenge

## Overview

In this foundational challenge, you'll develop essential hardware knowledge by identifying the three most critical components on a computer motherboard: the CPU, RAM, and Hard Drive connection. This hands-on exercise builds your understanding of physical computer architecture.

## Objective

Accurately identify and label the CPU socket, RAM slots, and Hard Drive (SATA/M.2) connections on a motherboard diagram or photo, then explain the function of each component.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find a Motherboard Image

Choose ONE of these options:

**Option A: Use a Provided Image**
Search for "modern ATX motherboard labeled" on Google Images and select a clear, high-resolution photo showing a complete motherboard.

**Option B: Physical Inspection**
If you have access to a desktop computer, carefully open the case (with permission) and photograph the motherboard. Ensure good lighting and focus.

**Recommended:** Look for modern boards (2018+) with clearly visible components like ASUS ROG, MSI Gaming, or Gigabyte AORUS series.

### Step 2: Identify the Components

Using your textbook and online resources, locate these components:

**1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- Look for: Large square socket, often covered by a heatsink/fan
- Common types: LGA1700 (Intel), AM5 (AMD)
- Usually located: Center or upper-center of motherboard
- Key identifier: Metal retention bracket or large cooler mounting holes

**2. RAM Slots (Memory)**
- Look for: Long parallel slots with clips on each end
- Common configuration: 2 or 4 slots, usually color-coded
- Usually located: Right side of CPU socket
- Key identifier: DIMM slots approximately 5-6 inches long

**3. Hard Drive Connections**
- Look for TWO types:
  - **SATA Ports:** Small L-shaped connectors (usually 4-6 ports)
  - **M.2 Slots:** Horizontal slots for NVMe SSDs (1-3 slots)
- Usually located: Bottom-right area or between PCIe slots
- Key identifier: SATA ports labeled "SATA_0, SATA_1" etc.

### Step 3: Label Your Diagram

Use an image editor to:

1. Draw arrows or boxes pointing to each component
2. Label clearly: "CPU Socket," "RAM Slots," "SATA Ports," "M.2 Slot"
3. Use different colors for each component type (e.g., red for CPU, blue for RAM, green for storage)
4. Add a title: "Motherboard Component Map - [Your Name]"

### Step 4: Write Component Descriptions

For each component, write 2-3 sentences covering:

**CPU:**
- What it does (processing calculations, running programs)
- Why it's called the "brain" of the computer
- How it connects to the motherboard

**RAM:**
- What it does (temporary data storage, active program memory)
- Why more RAM improves performance
- How it differs from permanent storage

**Hard Drive Connection:**
- What it does (connects storage devices)
- Difference between SATA and M.2/NVMe
- Why storage is essential for the operating system

### Step 5: Create Your Submission

Organize your work:

```
motherboard-identification-[yourname].png (labeled diagram)
component-descriptions.txt (or .md)

Content of component-descriptions.txt:
================================
MOTHERBOARD COMPONENT IDENTIFICATION
By: [Your Name]
Date: February 9, 2026
================================

CPU (Central Processing Unit):
[Your 2-3 sentence description]

RAM (Random Access Memory):
[Your 2-3 sentence description]

Hard Drive Connections (SATA/M.2):
[Your 2-3 sentence description]

Motherboard Model Identified: [e.g., ASUS ROG Strix B550-F]
Form Factor: [e.g., ATX]
```

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be assessed on:

1. **Accuracy** (40%): All three components correctly identified
2. **Clarity** (30%): Labels are clear, readable, and well-positioned
3. **Descriptions** (20%): Explanations demonstrate understanding
4. **Presentation** (10%): Clean, organized, professional appearance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Confusing the CPU socket with the chipset heatsink
- Labeling PCIe slots as RAM slots (RAM slots have clips on both ends)
- Missing M.2 slots (they're smaller and easy to overlook)
- Using blurry or low-resolution images
- Not specifying WHICH SATA ports or M.2 slots you're identifying

## Bonus Challenges

If you finish early, try these:

- Identify and label the chipset, PCIe x16 slot, and 24-pin power connector
- Research and note the specific CPU socket type (e.g., LGA1700, AM5)
- Find the CMOS battery and explain its purpose
- Identify the audio chip and network interface controller
- Compare your motherboard to a laptop motherboard and note differences

## Real-World Application

Understanding motherboard layout helps you:
- Build or upgrade your own PC
- Diagnose hardware problems
- Understand computer specifications when shopping
- Communicate with IT professionals
- Prepare for CompTIA A+ certification

## Tips for Success

1. Start with a clear, well-lit image
2. Zoom in to see small text labels on the board itself
3. Cross-reference with your textbook's motherboard diagrams
4. Use the manufacturer's website to confirm component locations
5. Don't rush—accuracy is more important than speed

## Submission Format

Submit both files:
- `motherboard-identification-[yourname].png` (or .jpg)
- `component-descriptions.txt` (or .md or .pdf)

Good luck with your first hardware challenge!
