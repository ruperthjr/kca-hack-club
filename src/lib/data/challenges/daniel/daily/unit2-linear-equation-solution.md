# Solving a Linear Equation: 2x + 5 = 15

## Overview

Solving linear equations is a foundational skill in mathematics and computer science, essential for algorithm analysis, data modeling, and logical reasoning. This challenge guides you through isolating variables and verifying solutions using algebraic methods.

## Objective

Find the value of x that satisfies the equation 2x + 5 = 15, showing each step clearly and verifying your answer.

## Prerequisites

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Understanding of algebraic notation and variables
- Logical reasoning skills

## Instructions

### Part 1: Isolate the Variable Term

Start with the equation:
```
2x + 5 = 15
```
Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with x:
```
2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
2x = 10
```

### Part 2: Solve for x

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:
```
2x / 2 = 10 / 2
x = 5
```

### Part 3: Verify the Solution

Substitute x = 5 back into the original equation:
```
2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
```
Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.

## Deliverables

1. Step-by-step solution for 2x + 5 = 15
2. Final value of x
3. Verification statement with substitution
4. Clear documentation of each step
5. Summary of the solution process

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                        | Weight | Description                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| Correct operations on both sides | 40%    | Subtraction and division applied correctly  |
| Final value of x                 | 20%    | Accurate solution for x                     |
| Verification                     | 20%    | Substitution confirms correctness           |
| Step clarity and documentation   | 20%    | Steps are clearly presented and explained   |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Always perform the same operation on both sides of the equation.
- Subtract before dividing when isolating variables.
- Double-check arithmetic, especially with negative numbers.
- Verification helps catch errors early.
- Write each step clearly to avoid confusion.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Solve 3x - 7 = 11.
2. Solve (x/4) + 2 = 6.
3. Solve 2(x + 3) = 16 (distribute first).
