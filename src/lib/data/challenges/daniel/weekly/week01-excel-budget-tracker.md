# Personal Budget Tracker in Excel

## Overview

This challenge guides you through building a comprehensive personal budget tracker in Microsoft Excel. You'll automate financial calculations, visualize spending patterns, and design an interactive dashboard—gaining practical spreadsheet and data analysis skills for real-world finance management.

## Objective

Create a multi-sheet Excel workbook that tracks income, expenses, and savings, with automated calculations, interactive charts, and a user-friendly dashboard. The tracker should provide clear visual feedback on your financial health and progress toward goals.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Microsoft Excel.
- Familiarity with spreadsheet structure and formulas.
- Sample financial data (income, expenses, categories).
- Willingness to explore Excel's charting and validation tools.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Workbook Structure & Data Entry

1. Create three sheets: **Data Entry**, **Calculations**, and **Dashboard**.
2. In the Data Entry sheet, build a table with columns: Date, Category, Description, Amount, Type (Income/Expense).
3. Add at least 10 categories (e.g., Salary, Rent, Groceries, Utilities, Entertainment).
4. Apply data validation for Category and Type columns (dropdown lists).
5. Format the table for readability (alternating row colors, clear headers).

### Part 2: Automated Calculations & Summaries

1. Use `SUMIF`/`SUMIFS` to calculate monthly totals for income and expenses.
2. Compute monthly savings (Income - Expenses).
3. Break down expenses by category and calculate the percentage of income spent per category.
4. Add year-to-date totals for income, expenses, and savings.
5. Protect calculation cells to prevent accidental edits.

### Part 3: Dashboard & Visualization

1. Design a dashboard sheet with key metrics: Current Balance, Monthly Savings, Top Expense Category.
2. Insert at least three chart types (e.g., Pie for expense distribution, Bar for monthly expenses, Line for savings growth).
3. Use PivotTables for dynamic summaries and filtering.
4. Add slicers or timeline controls for interactive filtering by month or category.
5. Apply professional color schemes and ensure all charts update dynamically with new data.

## Deliverables

1. Excel workbook (.xlsx) with Data Entry, Calculations, and Dashboard sheets.
2. At least 10 unique formulas for calculations and summaries.
3. Interactive dashboard with 3+ chart types and dynamic filtering.
4. Data validation on at least 2 input fields.
5. One-page user guide (PDF) with screenshots and formula explanations.

| Documentation           | 10%    | Quality of user guide and formula explanations.   |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use named ranges for key cells to simplify formulas.
- Avoid hard-coding values; rely on formulas for calculations.
- Test with various data to ensure charts and summaries update correctly.
- Protect formula cells to prevent accidental changes.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all sheets.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Add a "Goals" sheet with progress bars for savings targets.
2. Implement a debt payoff calculator or budget vs. actual comparison.
3. Create macro buttons for common actions (e.g., clear data, export to PDF).
