# Academic Research Portfolio Website

## Overview

This challenge involves creating a professional academic portfolio website to showcase your research background, technical skills, and academic achievements. The project emphasizes clear communication, responsive design, and adherence to web accessibility standards, resulting in a polished digital presence for academic and professional networking.

## Objective

Build a responsive, multi-page website that serves as your digital academic presence. The site should highlight your research profile, technical expertise, and career objectives in a format suitable for both academic and industry audiences, deployed live on the web.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling.
- A GitHub account for version control and for hosting the website via GitHub Pages.
- Academic content ready for publication, such as a Curriculum Vitae (CV), research project descriptions, and a list of publications.
- Familiarity with core responsive design principles and the importance of web accessibility.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Content Preparation and Structuring

1.  **Define Your Academic Identity:** Clearly articulate your research focus, key qualifications, and career goals.
2.  **Gather Materials:** Compile your CV, publication list, project descriptions, and a professional headshot or relevant images.
3.  **Plan Website Structure:** Create an outline for your website, including a Home page, Research page, CV page, Projects/Publications page, and a Contact page.
4.  **Create File Structure:** Set up your project folder with `index.html`, separate HTML files for other pages, a `css` folder for your stylesheet, and an `assets` or `images` folder.

### Part 2: Website Development and Styling

1.  **Build the HTML Skeleton:** Write the semantic HTML for each page, including `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` tags. Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
2.  **Design the Homepage:** Create a compelling homepage with a professional introduction, a clear navigation menu, and links to other sections.
3.  **Develop Content Pages:** Populate the Research, CV, and Projects pages with your prepared content, using appropriate headings and lists to organize information.
4.  **Apply CSS and Responsive Design:** Write CSS to style your website with a professional color scheme and typography. Use media queries to ensure the layout adapts gracefully to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

### Part 3: Deployment and Final Polish

1.  **Initialize Git and Push to GitHub:** Initialize a Git repository in your project folder, commit your files, and push them to a new repository on GitHub.
2.  **Configure GitHub Pages:** In your repository's settings, navigate to the "Pages" section and configure it to deploy from your main branch.
3.  **Test the Live Site:** Once deployed, thoroughly test the live website. Check all links, ensure responsiveness on different devices, and validate that the site is accessible.

## Deliverables

1.  A live academic portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages, accessible via a public URL.
2.  A GitHub repository containing all source code, with a clean commit history and a detailed README.md file.
3.  A responsive design that is functional and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
4.  Clearly defined sections for your research, CV, projects/publications, and contact information.
5.  An accessible design that adheres to web standards, ensuring it is usable by everyone.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Academic Content & Clarity | 30% | The quality, depth, and professional presentation of research and academic information. |
| Design & Responsiveness | 25% | The overall aesthetic, user experience, and flawless adaptability to different screen sizes. |
| Technical Implementation | 20% | Quality of HTML/CSS, use of semantic markup, and adherence to coding best practices. |
| Content Organization | 15% | Logical site structure, intuitive navigation, and ease of finding information. |
| Deployment & Polish | 10% | Successful live deployment on GitHub Pages with no broken links or console errors. |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

-   **Tip:** Use consistent citation formats (e.g., APA, MLA) for all academic publications and references.
-   **Tip:** Keep the design clean and professional. Prioritize readability and let your content be the focus.
-   **Mistake:** Forgetting to include descriptive `alt` text for all images, which is crucial for accessibility.
-   **Mistake:** Not testing the website on actual mobile devices, as browser developer tools don't always capture every nuance.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1.  **Interactive Timeline:** Create an interactive timeline of your research journey and key academic milestones using CSS and JavaScript.
2.  **Dark Mode Toggle:** Implement a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between a light and dark mode, saving their preference in `localStorage`.
3.  **Filterable Publications:** If you have many publications, add JavaScript-based filters to allow users to sort them by year, topic, or publication type.

## Submission

Submit the live website URL and the link to your public GitHub repository. Ensure the repository's README.md file includes a project overview, a link to the live site, and any notes on your design choices or setup.
