# Oral Introduction Challenge: Team Meeting Presentation

## Overview

Effective self-introduction establishes credibility, builds relationships, and sets the tone for professional collaboration. A well-structured 2-minute introduction conveys essential information while demonstrating communication competence.

## Objective

Prepare and deliver a 2-minute oral introduction for a team meeting scenario. Structure your content effectively, apply delivery techniques, and present with confidence and clarity.

## Instructions

### 1. Structure Your Introduction

Break your introduction into five clear sections, each with a suggested time allocation:

- **Opening (0:00 - 0:15):** Greeting, name, current role, and a positive statement about joining the team.
- **Professional Background (0:15 - 0:45):** Education, career highlights, previous roles, and transition to current position.
- **Skills & Expertise (0:45 - 1:15):** Key technical and soft skills, accomplishments, and certifications.
- **Current Role & Contribution (1:15 - 1:40):** Responsibilities, projects, planned contributions, and goals.
- **Closing & Connection (1:40 - 2:00):** Enthusiasm for collaboration, invitation to connect, preferred communication method, and thanks.

Use the provided template to draft your script, ensuring each section is concise and relevant.

### 2. Use the Sample Script Framework

Adapt the following framework with your own information:

```
[0:00-0:15] OPENING
"Good morning everyone! I'm [Your Name], joining as the new [Your Position]. I'm really excited to be part of this team and look forward to collaborating with all of you."

[0:15-0:45] PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
"I come from a background in [Your Field], with a [Your Degree] from [Your University]. Over the past [Number] years, I've worked in [Industry/Sector], most recently as a [Previous Position] at [Previous Company], where I focused on [Key Responsibility]."

[0:45-1:15] SKILLS & EXPERTISE
"Technically, I specialize in [Skill 1], [Skill 2], and [Skill 3]. I'm particularly experienced with [Technology/Tool] and have successfully [Specific Achievement]. My strengths include [Soft Skill 1] and [Soft Skill 2], which I believe will help me contribute effectively to our team's goals."

[1:15-1:40] CURRENT FOCUS
"In my new role, I'll be focusing on [Current Responsibility]. I'm especially excited about [Specific Project] because [Reason]. I hope to bring [Specific Contribution] to the team and help us achieve [Team Goal]."

[1:40-2:00] CLOSING
"I'm really looking forward to working with each of you and learning from your expertise. Please feel free to reach out - I'm always open to chat about [Topic] or grab a virtual coffee. Thank you for the warm welcome!"
```

### 3. Practice Delivery Techniques

Focus on:

- **Vocal Delivery:** Maintain a pace of 140-160 words per minute, use strategic pauses, and vary your speed for emphasis.
- **Volume & Projection:** Speak clearly and audibly, projecting from your diaphragm.
- **Articulation & Pronunciation:** Enunciate clearly, especially on challenging words and names.
- **Non-Verbal Communication:** Make eye contact (camera or audience), use confident posture and natural gestures, and match facial expressions to your message.
- **Visual Elements (if virtual):** Ensure a professional background, good lighting, and centered framing.

### 4. Practice and Refine

Follow a four-phase practice schedule:

1. **Content Development:** Write and edit your script, time your reading, and create a bullet-point outline.
2. **Initial Practice:** Practice with your script and outline, record audio, and adjust pacing.
3. **Delivery Practice:** Practice in front of a mirror, record video, and focus on non-verbal cues.
4. **Final Preparation:** Do a final run-through, record your final version, and review against the checklist.

Set up your recording environment for clear audio and video.

### 5. Evaluate Your Performance

Assess your introduction using these criteria:

- **Content (40%):** Clear structure, completeness, relevance, conciseness, and clarity.
- **Delivery (40%):** Vocal quality, pacing, energy, articulation, non-verbal communication, and timing.
- **Professionalism (20%):** Appearance, confidence, authenticity, engagement, and overall impact.

Use the self-assessment checklist to review your recording for all key elements.

### 6. Address Common Challenges

- **Nervousness:** Practice deep breathing, positive self-talk, and focus on your message.
- **Timing Issues:** Use a timer and edit content to fit the 2-minute window.
- **Monotone Delivery:** Vary pitch and emphasize key points.
- **Filler Words:** Pause instead of using "um" or "uh".

### 7. Adapt for Different Contexts

Adjust your introduction style for:

- **Formal Meetings:** Use structured language and formal greetings.
- **Informal Gatherings:** Adopt a conversational tone and include personal interests.
- **Virtual Settings:** Prioritize camera eye contact and clear audio.
