# Proposition Logic Challenge: The Liar Paradox

## Overview

The Liar Paradox—"This statement is false"—is a classic example that challenges the foundations of propositional logic. Understanding why this statement cannot be classified as a proposition is essential for grasping the limits of formal logic and its applications in mathematics and computer science.

## Objective

Determine whether "This statement is false" qualifies as a proposition using formal logic principles. Analyze its logical structure, attempt to assign truth values, and explain the resulting paradox.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic propositional logic concepts
- Familiarity with truth values and logical connectives
- Ability to construct and interpret truth tables
- Critical thinking skills

## Instructions

### Part 1: Define and Classify Propositions

- Provide the formal definition of a proposition.
- List and explain the criteria for a statement to be a proposition.
- Apply these criteria to "This statement is false" and document your findings.

### Part 2: Truth Value Analysis

- Attempt to assign both TRUE and FALSE to the statement.
- Construct a truth table or logical analysis showing the contradictions.
- Clearly explain why the statement cannot be consistently classified as true or false.

### Part 3: Context and Applications

- Summarize the historical and philosophical context of the Liar Paradox.
- Discuss its significance in mathematics and computer science (e.g., self-reference, undecidability, recursion).
- Provide examples of valid propositions and contrast them with paradoxical or invalid statements.

## Deliverables

1. Written analysis (500-800 words) covering all required points
2. Completed truth table and classification table
3. Examples of valid and invalid propositions
4. Summary of historical and computing context
5. References to all sources used

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Conceptual Understanding| 30%    | Accurate definitions and logical criteria         |
| Logical Analysis        | 40%    | Correct truth value analysis and contradiction   |
| Contextual Knowledge    | 20%    | Historical and computing context explained       |
| Communication          | 10%    | Clarity, organization, and proper formatting     |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Ensure all five criteria for propositions are addressed
- Clearly show contradictions in truth value assignment
- Avoid confusing paradoxes with valid propositions
- Cite all resources and examples used

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Explore three-valued or paraconsistent logic as alternative approaches
2. Research how programming languages and proof assistants handle self-reference
