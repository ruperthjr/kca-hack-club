# Project Kickoff Meeting Agenda

## Overview

A well-structured kickoff meeting is essential for aligning stakeholders, clarifying project goals, and establishing clear roles and expectations. This challenge guides you in drafting a realistic, professional agenda for a software project kickoff, ensuring all critical topics are addressed within a 60-minute timeframe.

## Objective

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of software project phases and roles
- Familiarity with word processing tools (Word, Google Docs, Markdown)
- Access to a virtual meeting platform (if remote)
- No prior project management experience required

## Instructions

### Part 1: Define the Meeting Header

- Include date, time, location (physical or virtual), and expected attendees
- State the overall purpose of the meeting in one sentence

### Part 2: List Agenda Items with Time Allocations

- Draft at least five distinct agenda items, each with:
    - Time slot (e.g., 10:00–10:10)
    - Topic title
    - Brief description (1–2 sentences)
    - Facilitator/owner

    - Scope and key deliverables (15 min)
    - Roles and responsibilities (10 min)
    - Timeline and major milestones (10 min)
    - Next steps and action items (5 min)
    - Q&A (5 min)

### Part 3: Add Supporting Details
