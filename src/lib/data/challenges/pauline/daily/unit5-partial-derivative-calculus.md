# Partial Derivative of x²y

## Overview

Partial derivatives generalize the concept of differentiation to functions of several variables. By computing the partial derivative of f(x, y) = x²y with respect to x, you will deepen your understanding of how multivariable functions change when one variable varies and the others are held constant—a foundational skill in calculus, physics, and engineering.

## Objective

Compute the partial derivative ∂f/∂x for f(x, y) = x²y and explain its interpretation in the context of multivariable functions.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with single-variable differentiation and the power rule.
- Understanding of treating variables as constants during partial differentiation.
- Basic algebraic manipulation skills.
- Ability to write clear mathematical steps.
- Interest in exploring calculus concepts.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Compute the Partial Derivative

1. Write the function: f(x, y) = x²y.
2. Treat y as a constant.
3. Differentiate x² with respect to x using the power rule: d/dx(x²) = 2x.
4. Multiply the constant y by the derivative: ∂f/∂x = y · 2x = 2xy.
5. Write the final result: ∂f/∂x = 2xy.

### Part 2: Interpret the Result

- In one or two sentences, explain what ∂f/∂x = 2xy means. For example: "It represents the instantaneous rate of change of f with respect to x, holding y constant."

### Part 3: Check Your Understanding

- Substitute a value for y (e.g., y = 3) and verify the derivative for f(x, 3) = 3x².
- Confirm that the result matches the expected single-variable derivative.

## Deliverables

1. Step-by-step written or typed solution for ∂f/∂x.
2. A brief paragraph interpreting the result.
3. Clearly labeled calculations and explanations.
4. Submission as a PDF or image file.
5. Your name and the challenge title included.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                    | Weight | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Correctness of derivative   | 60%    | ∂f/∂x is correctly computed as 2xy.                              |
| Step-by-step reasoning      | 30%    | Clear demonstration of treating y as constant and applying rules. |
| Interpretation              | 10%    | Accurate explanation of the partial derivative's meaning.         |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Only differentiate with respect to x; treat y as a constant.
- Do not apply the product rule incorrectly.
- Substitute values for y to check your work.
- Avoid differentiating both variables at once.
- Clearly show each step for full credit.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Compute ∂f/∂y for f(x, y) = x²y and compare it to ∂f/∂x.
2. Find the partial derivatives of f(x, y) = x³y² + sin(xy) with respect to both x and y.
