# Definition of a Set and Finite Set Example

## Overview

Set theory is a cornerstone of modern mathematics and computer science, providing the language for describing collections of objects. Understanding sets and their notation is essential for topics ranging from algorithms to databases and logic.

## Objective

Define what a set is, demonstrate two standard notations for sets, and provide three original examples of finite sets, including their cardinalities.

## Prerequisites

- Basic math literacy
- No prior set theory experience required
- Ability to write clear explanations

## Instructions

### Part 1: Define a Set

- Write a precise definition: A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, called elements, considered as a single entity.
- Explain "well-defined": There must be a clear rule to determine if an object belongs to the set.
- Note: Elements are unordered and duplicates are not counted.

### Part 2: Show Notation

- **Roster (tabular) form:** List elements inside curly braces, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.
- **Set-builder notation:** Describe the property of elements, e.g., `{x ∈ ℕ | x < 4}`.

### Part 3: Provide Three Finite Set Examples

For each example:
- Write in roster form.
- Write in set-builder notation (if possible).
- State its cardinality (number of elements).
- Include at least one example from everyday life and one from mathematics/computer science.

## Deliverables

1. Markdown document with definition, notation, and three finite set examples.
2. Each example includes roster form, set-builder notation, and cardinality.
3. Brief reflection on the importance of sets.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition accuracy     | 30%    | Correct, clear definition of a set and its properties    |
| Notation usage          | 30%    | Proper use of roster and set-builder notation            |
| Example quality         | 30%    | Three distinct, well-explained finite sets with cardinalities |
| Clarity                 | 10%    | Clear, error-free writing and logical organization       |

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use curly braces `{}` for sets, not parentheses or brackets.
- Do not include duplicate elements in roster form.
- Specify the domain in set-builder notation.
- Remember: "finite" does not mean "small".

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Define an infinite set and provide two examples.
2. Explain the difference between a set and a multiset (bag).
3. Describe the empty set and explain why it is finite.
