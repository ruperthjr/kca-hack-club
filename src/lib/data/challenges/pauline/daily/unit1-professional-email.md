# Professional Client Email: Requirements Gathering

## Overview

Clear and professional communication with clients is essential for successful software projects. This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where you must gather comprehensive requirements from a client via email before starting a web application project.

## Objective

Write a professional email to a hypothetical client, requesting all necessary project requirements for building a website with online ordering capabilities. Demonstrate your ability to structure questions, use business language, and set clear expectations.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic project requirements
- Familiarity with software development lifecycle
- Access to a text editor or email client
- Knowledge of professional email structure

## Instructions

### Part 1: Analyze the Scenario

- Client: Sarah Chen, Owner of "GreenLeaf Organic Cafe"
- Project: Website with online ordering
- Your Role: Software Developer / Project Lead
- Context: First detailed follow-up after initial inquiry

### Part 2: Draft the Professional Email

1. **Subject Line:** Write a clear, specific, and actionable subject (e.g., "GreenLeaf Cafe Website - Requirements Discussion").
2. **Greeting & Opening:** Use a professional salutation, thank the client, restate the project, and state the email’s purpose.
3. **Organize Questions:** Group your requirements questions into categories:
   - Business Goals & Audience
   - Features & Functionality
   - Content & Design
   - Technical Requirements
   - Timeline & Budget
4. **Call to Action:** Request a response by a specific date and offer options for follow-up (email or call).
5. **Closing & Signature:** Express enthusiasm, offer availability for questions, and include a complete signature block.

### Part 3: Create a Requirements Checklist

- List all key information you need from the client, organized by category, using checkboxes for tracking.

### Part 4: Self-Evaluation

- Review your email for structure, clarity, tone, and completeness using a rubric.

## Deliverables

1. `client-email.md` — Your professional email draft (250-350 words)
2. `requirements-checklist.md` — Organized checklist of required information
3. `self-evaluation.md` — Self-assessment using provided criteria

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                | Weight | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Professional Structure  | 30%    | Proper email format, greeting, closing, signature|
| Requirements Coverage   | 40%    | All essential areas and clear, actionable questions|
| Communication Quality   | 30%    | Professional tone, clarity, conciseness, no errors|

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Use a specific, professional subject line
- Organize questions logically by category
- Avoid overly casual or formal language
- Proofread for spelling and grammar
- Don’t forget the signature block and call to action

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Adapt the email for a different client (e.g., tech startup, non-profit, e-commerce)
2. Write a follow-up email if the client does not respond

## Submission

Submit a folder named `professional-email-[yourname]` containing all deliverables. Ensure files are named and formatted as specified.
