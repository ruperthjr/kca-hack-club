# Cloud Computing Benefits: 3‑Slide PowerPoint Challenge

## Overview

Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations deploy, scale, and manage technology. Effectively communicating its benefits is a vital skill for both technical and non-technical professionals. In this challenge, you'll design a concise, visually appealing three-slide presentation that highlights the top advantages of cloud computing for a general audience.

## Objective

Create a three-slide presentation that clearly and persuasively explains three distinct benefits of cloud computing, using strong visuals, minimal text, and professional speaker notes.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Access to PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva
- Ability to insert and format images/icons
- Familiarity with using speaker notes

## Instructions

### Part 1: Plan Your Content

- Select three key benefits of cloud computing (e.g., cost savings, scalability, reliability).
- For each benefit, write a clear headline (5–7 words) and a supporting sentence.
- Choose a simple visual metaphor or icon for each benefit.

### Part 2: Build the Slides

- Slide 1: Benefit 1 + a brief introductory line (serves as both intro and first benefit).
- Slide 2: Benefit 2 (headline, supporting text, visual/icon).
- Slide 3: Benefit 3 (headline, supporting text, visual/icon).
- Apply consistent design, color theme, and font across all slides.

### Part 3: Add Speaker Notes

- For each slide, write 2–3 sentences in the speaker notes area to expand on the slide content and guide your spoken delivery.

## Deliverables

1. A PowerPoint (.pptx), Google Slides, or Canva link with exactly three slides.
2. Speaker notes for each slide (2–3 sentences per slide).
3. Consistent, professional slide design with relevant visuals/icons.
