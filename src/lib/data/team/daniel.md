# About Daniel

## Background
I am a first-year Software Development student at KCA University, taking my first determined steps into the vast world of technology. My curiosity drives me to understand how things are built from the ground up.

## Role at Hack Club
As a beginner developer, my focus at Hack Club is on:
- **Learning & Building:** Actively mastering the fundamentals, starting with HTML and CSS, to construct the building blocks of the web.
- **Collaboration:** Engaging with the community to learn from peers and contribute to team projects.
- **Growth Mindset:** Embracing the beginner's journey, documenting progress, and steadily expanding my skill set.

## Current Focus & Goals
My primary mission is to conquer the front-end trilogy (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) within my set timelines. I'm methodically working through HTML now, with plans to soon bring style with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript. I'm also exploring how spatial technology like ArcGIS intersects with web development.

## Get in Touch
I'm eager to connect, learn, and grow! Whether you have advice, resources, or just want to talk tech, feel free to reach out. Let's build the future, one line of code at a time.
