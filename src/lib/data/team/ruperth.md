bio: "Nairobi-based Software Engineer and builder. My thing is turning first principles into products that work. Whether it's an LLM agent, a full-stack web app, or a cross-platform mobile experience, I'm focused on the path from 'what if' to 'here, use this.' Right now, that means RAG workflows, production AI systems, and Flutter. I'm driven by impact."
